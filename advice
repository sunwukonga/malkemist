 1. Know your goal of storytelling
- “Storytelling is knowing that everything from your first to your last sentence is leading to a singular goal."
- “Stories confirm who we are. And nothing does a greater affirmation than when we connect through stories."

2. Make the audience care
- “Make me care, please, emotionally, intellectually, aesthetically, just make me care."

3. Make the audience put things together
- “We are born problem solvers. We are compelled to deduce, and to deduct."
- "Don’t give the audience the entire story. Don’t give them 4. Give them 2+2."

4. Find the “spine” that drive your main character’s decisions
- “All well-drawn characters have a spine. The character has an inner motor, a dominant, unconscious goal that they're striving for, an itch that they can’t scratch."

5. Embrace changes in your stories
- "Change is fundamental in stories."
- “If things go static, stories die, because life is never static."

6. Construct anticipation with uncertainty
- “Drama is anticipation mingled with uncertainty."

7. Make your audience like your main character
- Make your main character likable

8. Have a theme
- “A strong theme is always running through a well-told story."

9. Invoke wonder
- “Have them surrender to wonder."
- “The best story infuses wonder."

10. Express values you personally feel deep inside
- “Use what you know. Draw from it. It doesn’t always mean plot or fact. It means capturing a truth from your experience, expressing values you personally feel deep down in your core."

The bright full moon shone through a gap in the low cloud cover
just as Jack launched himself over a narrow alley and landed
lightly on the rough tiles of the next roof. His bare feet made no
sound on contact, but there was a slight grinding groan as the
tiles adjusted to his weight. His heavily callused feet skittering
merrily across the familiar landscape, moving with practiced grace,
and never missing a step. Another alley, and he grinned with joy as
he felt himself sail effortlessly across the man-made chasm.

His imagination roamed unfettered as he alternatively jogged,
stepped, sprinted, and leaped across the tiled world. Two illusory
hawks swooped from the sky to fasten upon his outstretched arms and
carried him with swooping ecstasy across a particularly wide gap.
At his bidding, flat mushrooms grew underfoot to cushion his
footsteps before fading back into the red tile. A gust of hot air
buoyed him through yet another leap.

He was close now. A gaggle of gnomes peered at him from the peak of
the roof. They were obviously an hallucination, but they caused him
to fear real eyes upon him. His wild imagination needed reining in
now, and he did it sternly. The gnomes sank bashfully from view.

The rooves had grown larger and the chimney's taller, and that meant
rich pickings. Tiptoeing to the edge of the roof, only a handspan
from a fall that would leave him crippled or dead, he examined the
street below to get his bearings.

He bit his lip and squinted. Three rooftops to go.

Creeping with care in the last dozen yards, he tested each tile
with a tentative foot before applying his weight. A dog yapped
somewhere below and a man swore into the otherwise quiet night.

Jack breathed in a long cool breath of air as he positioned himself
next to a particularly tall and imposing chimney. With wily
fingers, as callused as his toes, he began to work the first tile
free. Unbidden, he imagined his fingers were the flat hard pincers
he had seen in the foundry, and it seemed to help him grip the
tile. The ceramic scraped ever so slightly as he twisted it free of
its brothers, but made no other sound. Placing it on the upside of
the chimney, to guard against the freak misfortune of it sliding
off the steep roof, he attacked the second tile.

With both tiles out, the hole left behind was far too small for an
adult to squeeze through. Yet for Jack's lithe form it was perfect,
and he dangled his feet into the darkness without hesitation, the
gaping unknown giving him not a moment's pause.

Darkness. This was the tricky bit. Keeping his feet on the ceiling
joists and away from the ceiling slats—to keep from falling
through and causing a terrible racket—he began moving back and
forth along the joists, searching with trailing fingers for a
ceiling manhole.

His luck being what it was, he had covered most of the ceiling
before he found the ceiling manhole in the cramped space close to
the eaves. Heart pounding furiously, he gently—ever so gently—
pulled the manhole cover up and into the attic space.

Silence. Still as a cat in the grass as the butcher strolls by, he
listened.

Strange smells wafted up from the hallway below. Rich people's
houses always smelled funny. A very faint light lit the hall runner
and Jack was grateful, as it was hard enough moving around an
unfamiliar house, let alone doing it in pitch darkness.

Assured that nobody was up and about in the house below, Jack
lowered himself into the hallway. Legs dangling, he dropped almost
four feet to the floor. In silence, except for the furious pounding
of the blood in his ears.

He orientated himself by what he knew of the outside of the house
and the position of the kitchen. The kitchen would hold any silver
that the house had. He was not greedy. Gold might be kept in the
bedrooms, but he had no desire to pry it from anyone's fingers.

Taking a moment for himself, he crouched down on all fours and
pressed his nose against the bare wooden floor on one side of the
runner and took a long, slow sniff. It smelled wonderful. Jack had
no idea how they made these magical polished floors, but one day he
wanted one too.

He climbed to his feet and crept forward with slow and deliberate
steps along the hall runner, its plush fibers completely masking
his footfalls. The house was so quiet that Jack could hear it give
the occasional moan. The light in the hallway was given off by a
turned down oil lamp just before the landing to the stairs and Jack
eyed it enviously. He'd love to take it, but he could not get
anything for it, and the price of oil meant he couldn't use it
himself.

Drawing near the lamp, he noticed that the door opposite was open
wide enough for him to slip inside.

Jack sniffed, and then grinned as he wiped his moist palms against
his dirty trouser legs. Leather, fabric, and something else. This
room must be a lounge, and private lounges were often filled with
valuables. Trembling slightly, he unlimbered the lamp and held it
high as he entered the room. He gave the door a gentle, tentative
push. It creaked softly.

This was not Jack's first creaky door. He placed the lamp on the
floor, clear of the doorway, and then put his shoulder against the
edge of the door, pushing $towards its hinges and lifting slightly
as he swung it slowly and carefully closed. Not the slightest peep.
With it closed, he was free to explore in some peace.

The first thing he did was unlatch and open the window. It made
some noise, but it meant that he could not be trapped. He hung his
head briefly out the window to see where he was, and then started
turning the room over.

One wall was completely taken up by leather bound sheafs of paper,
and although Jack could not read, he gravitated $towards them,
fascinated. It was not something he could move, though he knew the
paper alone was immensely valuable. The craftmanship and beauty of
the bookcases implied that this collection was highly valued.

He ignored them with regret and turned his attention to the desk.
It too was beautiful, like almost everything in the room. A silver
paperweight and matching letter opener were the first items to make
their way into the folds of his black coat. Pulling a drawer open
he was confronted with a shallow wooden box. He opened it quickly
and was disappointed to find a pink hued crystal.

Nestled in its own silk lined box, it was clearly valuable. It was
pretty and it drew his eye like a lodestone, but Jack would never
be able to sell it. He almost put it back, but on an impulse he
slipped it into his baggy, oversized coat as well.

He opened the opposite drawer.

This drawer was filled with small glass vials. A shiver of unease
shook Jack. He had never seen anything like it, yet it made him
close the drawer quickly. A muffled curse sounded out in the
hallway, and before the sound faded Jack had moved to the window
and swung his legs out. He paused, watching the door with baited
breath.

The door swung inward with a sharp creak.

Jack jumped from the window with a flourish, his coat tails
flapping wildly in the air as the ground rushed up to meet him. He
stretched out his arms, high above his head, surely looking like a
frog that had just launched itself from a lily pad. Contact with
the ground brought his knees up and arms down in one fluid motion
that turned into a roll and had him up in a fraction of a moment,
sprinting for an open alley. A curse issued from the second story
window he had just leapt from, and then a muffled exhalation.

Instinctively, Jack bounced sharply off the alley wall towards the
opposite side, expecting an arrow. There was a muffled pop, like a
smashed glass bottle, and then a sizzling and hissing. Stumbling,
he fetched up against the opposite wall and turned wide-eyed to see
the wall he had just bounced from with his bare hands dissolve
behind a screen of billowing black smoke.

He scrambled a few yards farther down the alley, the slick, evil
smelling refuse on the ground coating his hands before he found his
feet again and ran on. He shot a look behind him to see if he was
being pursued, but could not see clearly through the tears that had
begun to well in his eyes, let alone through the noxious smoke.

"I've screwed up bad this time Mardy," he managed to sob as he
sprinted, the hairs on the back of his neck through to his scalp
tingling with alarm.

The worst thing was that she could not save him from this.

---

He made it home in short order, having practically skipped over the
heads of the few lurkers who were awake in the early hours before
sunrise. Pimps, prostitutes, drunks, thieves, watchers, and the odd
legitimately industrious individual whose work required them to
begin in the small hours of the day. Jack knew how to avoid
confrontation, which given his size, was absolutely necessary.

Candle light flickered through the second floor window of a room
that he shared with Mardy and the other three unwanted children. In
any city where children had any value at all, they would be called
orphans. But not in this city.

His small, informal family was lucky though. There were roughly
twenty tiny partitioned rooms like theirs on that floor, and only a
handful had a window. Of course, some people preferred not to have
a window because it made them harder to rob. Jack had to admit
somewhat wryly that that was a good point.

Until only two months ago, they had all been living in the shanty
town, but that had changed when Stine had gotten his job at the
foundry. His and Mardy's modest scrip, Jack's thievery, and the
beggings of Hat and Snot were enough to keep them in this much
safer area. The most luxurious living quarters in the shanty town
were poorly thatched huts, often with open sewerage ditches running
close by. They had not been living in one of those.

It had been Mardy's idea to move. There had been six of them, Mardy
was always taking in strays, but the baby had gotten sick for no
good reason that Jack could see. Just one of those things. But
Mardy blamed the shanty town, saying that it was not a healthy
place to live. Mardy had ambitions, she did not want to live in the
shanty town forever. She wanted to live in a real house, like the
people she hauled laundry for. She said that people who lived in
houses did not get sick like they did in the shanty.

Jack liked the idea of living in a house, so he had not mentioned
that just as many people had died in fancy houses as in the shanty
town during the great sickness that had swept through two years
ago. None of his family had died then.

Jack climbed the wall opposite their building, the mudbricks laid
haphazardly enough, even with the limewash applied, for him to do
it with ease. He peered in on his family. Mardy was the eldest and
the toughest of them, and she was up already, as usual. Her job
washing clothes down by the river started before dawn, hauling
dirty laundry from people's houses with the other girls.

A metallic rattle sounded in the distance.

<i>Was that armour? A scabbard?</i> He stared at the flagstones of
a nearby corner with the intensity of a prowling cat, though the
sound was at least one street over. The last thing he wanted was to
be taken by the city guard, given what had just happened. They did
not patrol the mud palaces as often as the high streets, and he
could not believe they were here by coincidence. He needed to go.
He turned his eyes back to the window, wishing that Stine, his
adoptive big brother, would get up so he could see his ugly mug one
last time.

Nothing. Even Mardy was gone.

Jack dropped back to the ground, carefully missing a hole that a
dog had dug in the dirt of the street. His throat was heavy with
the tears his eyes wanted to shed, but he pushed them down.
Instead, his brow furrowed in thought as he headed $towards Marten's
den. Marten's rats would still be out and about in the city, but
the big rat would be in his hole. Jack needed a safe place to stay,
somewhere outside the city, and he had a growing hope that Marten
could help with that.

Shortly thereafter Jack arrived at the den. The flickering light
shining through the gaps in the door let Jack know that someone was
definitely at home.

He tapped gently at the dry and desiccated wood. It might have been
a real door at some stage, but it had mostly rotted away. It stood
now through some kind of divine grace, with the bottom foot or so
completely gone, and a chunk missing from the upper right corner.
The wood looked so brittle under its complement of green and white
mould, that Jack was pretty sure that even he could kick it in.
That would have been a huge mistake though. The door stayed closed
because the man behind the door insisted that it stayed closed.
That was the only reason. He continued his gentle tapping until he
heard someone stir within.

The door opened quietly in on the dark interior, candlelight
flickering in the draught.

"Who is it?" Jack heard Marten's voice call out from within.

"Looks like the kid who got beaten by the city guard last week,"
came the reply from the guy at the door, his pocked-marked face
leering from behind the tattered wood.

Jack flushed. It had not been a beating. A kick up the bum at best.
He scowled at the greasy-haired, pocked-face door holder; but not
too hard, since Jack knew he was also a large and heavy-boned lad
who enjoyed punching people in the head.

Be bold, he told himself, and he strode into the hovel with his
head high, a scant moment before Marten said, "OK."

"I want onto the farm," said Jack in a firm voice, making out
Marten and one other person sitting with their backs to the wall in
the gloom.

The long lean-to had a poorly maintained thatch roof and straw
covered dirt floor that filled the space with the strong smell of
mould, but Sadel, Marten's woman, fought it with scents of thyme
and rosemary. The combination was not pleasant to Jack's nose.

"What farm?" came Marten's confused and slightly contemptuous
reply.

Marten's attitude only confirmed the whispers that Jack had heard
about the thief guild farm. He had heard it referred to in passing
by two separate sources, so Marten's evasions were not going to
fly.

Marten himself was neither a large, nor imposing figure. He was
a skinny, softly spoken, and almost delicate man. Yet his reputation
was far more fierce than his outward appearance gave credence. He
had been the head of this district of the thieves guild for almost
five years, having quietly disposed of the former incumbent before
Jack had grown a self-preservatory interest in local politics. In
that time, Jack had not heard a single whisper of anyone ever
crossing him in even the most minor of ways and living to tell of
it.

"I know about the farm," Jack replied, his voice flat and steady.
He did not allow any excitement or anxiety to seep into his voice.
He knew it was vital not to show any emotion here. The slightest
hint of anxiety would be used against him.

"You don't know shit, midget!" swore Sadel, her voice edged with a
screech that set Jack's nerves jangling. He hated her. He hated her
because she was dangerous.

"I know about the farm," Jack did not budge by the slightest
degree.

Jack had only been in here twice in the time that he had been
actively thieving. Once when he first began, to establish his right
to work, and once again during a dispute with another thief. Both
times he had tread most carefully to avoid setting off Sadel. He
had had plenty of time to consider the dynamic between the two, and
Jack was certain he knew exactly why Marten kept Sadel close by.
She was his dog.

Of course, not a literal dog. Just the crazy animal in the room
that removed the element of logic far enough away from the
discourse to present Marten's power to its full advantage. She was
the gatekeeper that allowed Marten to size someone up before he was
forced to respond himself. Otherwise, Marten was too logical, too
methodical. Those traits sometimes did not equate to the best
advantage, and he relied on Sadel to sew enough uncertainty and
discord for him to work the angles. Jack could admire the strategy
while hating being its target.

"The farm is not a free service, imp," Marten relented, "How do you
intend to pay your way?"

Sadel shot to her feet, her pinched face intense. Jack knew she
wanted to hurt him for getting past her defences. If Marten
conceded anything, she took it as a personal affront. Her failure.
She stalked up to Jack's side to stare down menacingly at him. She
was half a head taller than him, but he managed to ignore her.

"I can afford it," Jack said, a touch quickly.

Someone Jack had not noticed in the concealed recesses of the long
lean-to moved in the darkness, revealing his or her presence.
Jack's eyes shifted quickly before he could control himself.

"I haven't even given you a price yet," Marten rejoined, shaking
his head ever so slightly in doubt of Jack's means.

"You can't afford it you little shit," Sadel growled, practically
in his ear.

Jack smelled something unpleasant on a waft of Sadel's breath, and
turned his head slightly away with an ostentatious grimace. He
heard her hiss.

"But first," Marten said, raising his voice slightly with the
developing situation, "why do you need it?"

"Just a little heat I've picked up," Jack replied in what he
imagined was his coolest tone.

"No one spends time on the farm on the strength of a bad feeling
Jack," Marten surprised Jack by remembering his name, "you know
exactly who wants you, and you'll be out on your ear if you don't
tell me now."

Jack's insides fell in a rush. He had not prepared to spin a cover
story of what he was really running from. He would just have to
risk telling the truth. Still, that was not a particularly pleasant
truth. He held his tongue for several moments, fighting with
himself, before giving in.

"A malkemist."

Marten had been sitting quietly since Jack entered the room, but
now he went completely still.

A moment passed, then two. Sadel was alternatively looking to
Marten and then Jack, alarm growing on her face.

Marten said nothing further, just flicked his fingers $towards the
door.

Sadel pounced, a slap catching Jack behind the ear with surprising
force. She was giving off a strange whine of outrage, as though she
wanted to scream, but was holding it in. She punched and kicked
Jack $towards the door, and Jack did not resist. He was getting out
just as quickly as she wanted him out. As Jack half stumbled at the
door, she gave him a kick up the rear that propelled him forward.
It caused him to catch a foot on the threshold and sent him to the
ground outside in a graceless sprawl.

"Get away from here and don't come back whoreson!" cursed Sadel in
an intense but carrying whisper.

She stood glaring at him for a few moments, Jack busy rolling to
his feet and putting distance between himself and her, before the
doorkeeper all but pushed her out of the way to set the door closed
again.

It seemed that the thieves guild was just as scared of the
malkemists as everyone else. He wondered why he had thought it
might be different. Malkemists did things that should have been
impossible. They scared people. Even people who made a living not
being scared of a great many things.

Jack still needed to get out of town. He would just have to do it
without help. He started down the alley, another plan forming. He
had only walked a dozen steps when he heard the door move again.

"Hey boy! Come back," called the doorkeeper.

Jack's felt a spasm of real fear, and his mind quickly surmised
that Marten must have decided that there was more advantage in
presenting him for reward than simply abandoning him to his own
devices.

Jack ran.

The doorman made a noise that sounded like a growl, a bark, and a
shout all rolled into one, and came lumbering out of the lean-to.
Jack barely touched the dirt with his bare feet as he hared off,
leaping adroitly over a deep washout that rain had formed in the
street. He moved so far and fast in bare moments that the doorman
gave only token pursuit, giving up almost as soon as he had
started. Jack would have laughed in his face if he had dared turn
back.

It was just as well he did not indulge himself. With his eyes
forward, he got the jump on one of Marten's rats walking back up to
base before the poor sod even knew he should be giving chase.

Marten's lean-to was at the border between the mudbrick palaces—as
Jack's family called them—and the shanty town. The shanty town
built itself out of any material that promised to last more than a
week. The mudbrick palaces were built with compressed straw and
mud bricks, with a lime wash that sealed and protected it from the
elements. The rich however, built with stone, and that was where
Jack was headed now. $Towards the town proper where the buildings
became permanent structures made of stone, tile, and well seasoned
hardwoods.

Years of snooping around these areas, avoiding the attentions of
zealous guards, had endowed Jack with the skills he needed to move
through these cobbled streets undetected. It was not lost on him
that the town guard seemed to be out in unusual force, marching
rounds and sitting on street corners. Jack had his work cut out
avoiding them all.

He had two fences that he used. This one in the town proper,
and one among the mudbrick palaces. The one in the mudbrick palaces
was run by a goldsmith that Jack knew as Rat Tail. He did have a
real name, but Jack had never heard it. Rat Tail worked closely
with Marten, and Jack had no idea how quickly Marten would send out
the word to pick him up.

Fortunately, Jack had not always been the most scrupulous guild
member, and the majority of his jobs were done outside the
knowledge of the guild. Getting caught would have meant death at
any time, but Jack had always been a couple of steps ahead of the
plods who even tried to follow him through these streets. That
meant that he had had to fence through a contact that had
absolutely nothing to do with Marten, his rats, or the thieves
guild. Rat Tail would have ratted him out in an instant if he
showed unusual activity. Fencing his stolen metal through an upper
class contact also paid better.

Enter Rouger. Jack had found Rouger very deliberately. He knew what
he needed, and using what he knew about Rat Tail's profession,
goldsmithing, he had set out to develop more of those contacts. He
had not been green to the idea, he had simply copied it from Mardy.
Ever since Jack could remember he had been with Mardy on her
rounds, approaching houses on the high streets and wheedling jobs;
sometimes right out from under the noses of competing washer
outfits. It had been a small leap to apply those skills to his
particular need. He had haunted the town proper for a month, first
discovering all of the goldsmith shops that existed, and then
observing them each individually. He had found another fence like
Rat Tail almost immediately, but that was not what he wanted. A
fence like Rat Tail had a master to report to, and that was exactly
what Jack wanted to avoid.

Instead, he had searched for the weak link among the remaining
"honest" goldsmiths, those that had no familiar faces entering at
odd hours. It had not taken long to uncover Rouger's poor
reputation in the marketplace. His business practices should have
had him in a dungeon somewhere long since, but to Jack's
puzzlement, he continued on in trade unmolested. It was his first
lesson in the importance of framing how you stole, rather than what
you stole. To Jack, the man's lack of a moral compass was a
positive attribute, and a set of slightly heavy scale weights
affected him very little.

Jack's first approach to Rouger had been bumpy to say the least,
but the man had soon warmed up when he realized there was coin to
be made. It helped that he was an imbecile.

---

Rouger was a middle aged man with a growing midsection and terrible
breath. Both of which could probably be blamed on his fondness for
sweet pastries and strong cheeses. He was also a terrible
insomniac, which is the reason he was wide awake and at his
workbench when he heard three hollow taps from the square porthole
in his workroom floor. His palms instantly began to sweat with
anticipation, despite the general chill. This was often his
favourite time of the day, but that did not stop him grumbling as
he took a wooden mallet from the shelf to knock free the chocks
that kept the waxed wooden pallet in place over the sewer below.
The waxed pallet prevented the stench from entering the workroom
and it was quite a shock when he finally plucked it free.

In his haste he had forgotten to lay straw on the stone beside the
porthole, and he quickly strew some from a hessian bag. He rubbed
his nightcap over his bald head to scrape at an idle itch as the
black-haired boy climbed quickly out, accompanied by a cloud of
putrid air. The boy was thin, but not unhealthy. It was the
leanness of youthful activity, not starvation. His face was smooth
and pimple free. To Rouger, that just meant that he had not hit
puberty yet.

Rouger quickly replaced the pallet to block the smell of the
sewer, his face puckered around his nose, and chaffed his moist
hands together in anticipation. The boy did not smile, he never
smiled. He just darted his dark, glittering eyes around the room
quickly before settling them on Rouger.

"Well! Let's see it boy!" Rouger grumbled.

The boy slipped a hand into his tattered coat and drew forth a
knife. Rouger almost stepped back fearfully before he $recognised
the letter opener. He snatched it from the boy, angry with him for
the scare. The feel of the cool silver in his hand was enough to
convince him that it was real. His mouth jerked up into an
involuntarily smile.

"Anything else?"

A small wooden box and a silver elephant statue came out of the
boy's coat, the silver looking far too heavy to have been carried
by the worn and heavily patched fabric. Rouger almost laughed at
the incongruity. When the paperweight plonked heavily into his palm
he felt his teeth bare with pleasure, though his mood soured when
he noticed the boy's eyes watching him keenly from his grime
covered face. Rouger placed the two silver items onto his scale
dish.

"What's that?" asked Rouger, eyeing the pretty box.

"Nothing." said Jack, moving to replace it in his coat.

Rouger grabbed the boy's wrist in one deft hand and plucked the box
from his grasp. The boy was clever enough not to complain.

The exterior of the box was delicately inlaid with mother of pearl
in the form of intricately interwoven leaves. A heavy silver swing
catch bound the two halves of the box together, but if there was a
hinge it was carefully concealed.

Rouger licked his thin lips as he pressed a thumb against the
bottom of the catch, and then almost dropped the box as the lid
swung open in his hand.

"You idiot!" cried Rouger, "Do you know what you've done?"

He swung a backhand at the boy's head, but the boy ducked under it
with surprising agility. Frustrated and enraged he kicked at the
boy instead and propelled him clear off his patch of straw. An
action he immediately regretted as the boy's fouly besmirched feet
padded over his floor.

Rouger's head was swimming now with terrible scenarios, not least
of which was a couple of malkemist warlocks disintegrating his
front door and melting his corpulent self down for some kind of
soap in retribution. He squeezed his head between both hands, the
edge of the now closed box digging into his scalp, trying to think
clearly as his heart began to pound more and more furiously. He
could actually feel each distinct heartbeat thump in his chest.

He had to sacrifice the boy.

He lunged at the him, but the rascal danced out the way with a
hiss. Rouger would not be able to catch him with speed. Instead, he
slowly shepherded the boy into a corner, blocking off all escape
until he had nowhere to go. He finally caught the skinny whippet
with a gleeful cry, and gave him a sharp rap to the head for his
trouble.

Dragging him back to the manhole he fetched out a pair of irons
that he kept for thieves at his shop and shackled the boy to his
workbench. He had dropped the box in the scuffle and he looked
around to retrieve it.

Suddenly, there was a loud knock on the front door of his shop and
he cringed as a bolt of terror ripped through him. <i>Malkemists?
Already?</i> He met the boy's eyes. The idiot did not seem to
understand the danger at all, or if he did, he was not showing it.
<i>Idiot!</i>

"Sirness, let me go!" the boy demanded.

Rouger ignored him. He grabbed the letter opener and paperweight
from his workbench and rushed out of his workroom $towards his shop,
almost tripping in his haste. He sparked the lamp at the back of
the shop to life and stowed the ill-gotten silver on a nearby
shelf. He then hurried $towards the front door before $realising that
he was still in his nightgown and sleeping cap. He backtracked in
sweaty consternation to quickly change into his shop robes and
goldsmith hat.

The door was being pounded with a lot more force now, and Rouger
called out, beside himself.

"Wait, wait good Sirness, I'm coming!" he screeched, jowls
wobbling.

There was silence as Rouger began pulling the iron bolts on the
heavy wooden shopfront door. He took a moment with the last bolt to
wonder if he really did want to open the door before throwing it
back as well.

It was with some relief that he met the faces of two men from the
city guard, their hats showing middling rank. Rouger almost smiled.

It turned out to be a horrible prank of happenstance, because just
behind the two stood a very tall man with the pointy black hat of a
malkemist perched upon his head. His eyes were intense and
unforgiving.

"Do you mind if we come in good Sirness?" asked the malkemist, not
a sliver of a smile in his voice.

Rouger was struck dumb. He wanted to protest the hour, give some
excuse, but instead he just stood there with his mouth open. The
malkemist took his silence for consent and strode between the
guardsmen, and would have stepped on Rouger if he had not given way
at the last moment. Without further leave he strode boldly $towards
the back of the shop and with absolutely terrifying and unerring
accuracy to the shelf that held the recently purloined silver.

"Seize him," spoke the malkemist like a death knell.

Rouger's legs gave out just as they grabbed him and the two burly
guardsmen had some trouble keeping his bulk upright.

"Bring him, the rest is through here," called the malkemist,
pointing to the workroom, his gaze on some device in his hand.

Rouger was recovering himself now, his mind railing against his
cowardly constitution to pry survival from this terrible situation.

"I caught him. The thief. He's in my workroom," Rouger declared
with some force.

The malkemist's gaze turned from whatever was in his hand to regard
Rouger.

"Indeed," was all he said. He strode $towards the workroom.

The two guardsmen had to half carry, half drag Rouger to the
workroom, his legs simply were not working the way that they
should. The sight that greeted him drove him to his knees.

The boy was gone.

It took several moments for Rouger to process what he was seeing.
The shackles hung limp from his workbench, almost invisible except
that he was looking for them. The chocks and mallet were gone, as
was the straw that he had thrown on the floor. For a crazy moment
Rouger wondered if he had dreamed the boy coming. Then the
malkemist bent over and retrieved something from the floor. It was
the wooden box. The malkemist thumbed it open.

His disappointment was palpable.

"Where is the crystal?" he asked, eyes boring into Rouger's.

Rouger did not know.

---

Jack moved as swiftly as he could through the putrid waters of the
sewer. He had spent long hours with his feet soaking in these
turbid flows and had developed his own very particular way of
moving in the water to avoid splashing himself. He could have risen
to the streets almost immediately after climbing down from Rouger's
shop, but he felt safer in the sewer. He doubted the malkemists
would pursue anyone down here.

The darkness within was almost complete. Occasionally a poorly
sealed port would allow a shaft of light from the recently risen
sun to break through the murk, but those were generally few and far
between. He was mostly blind.

An intersecting tunnel yawned to his left, his ears telling him
immediately as the noise of his own passing disappeared into the
space, echoes vanishing. His skin registered the slight current of
air that stirred here. He was a master in this darkness, anyone who
wanted to find him would be using a torch or lantern. They would be
easy to avoid. His unseemly familiarity with these ways was natural
given how his presence on the streets above was likely to provoke
an unpleasant response from the city guard, whether he wore his
best coat or not.

He only owned one coat.

An errant beam of light illuminated a small patch of stone ahead,
recalling to Jack that the construction of this sewer had been the
work of malkemists. Something to do with the mortar that bound the
individual stones together and made it strong enough to support the
earth, roads, and buildings above. Stine had explained it to him,
but he had forgotten the important part he was sure. Remembering it
at all made him uneasy. The malkemists must have come down here to
oversee the work, perhaps they even had maps of these tunnels.

A plague of rats skittered and screeched somewhere ahead as Jack
approached, but he did not bother to slow for their alarm. Rats
were common down here. There was only one thing that found its way
into these stony tunnels that could give Jack pause, save for the
unexpected appearance of a malkemist, and they were much bigger
than rats. Their growls and razor sharp teeth could set his bones
shaking in his flesh. Jack would backtrack a long, long way, or
wait for hours to avoid them.

Recalling their sharp, intelligent, and challenging eyes made him
bare his own teeth in a feral display. He particularly hated the
one chained outside Rat Tail's shop. Why the man thought it was a
good idea to keep one so close, Jack had no idea. It could not be
good for business. It would lunge aggressively at random passers-by
and seemed to take special pleasure in tormenting Jack himself.
Still, it was chained and could be avoided. The ones that roamed
the streets were lawless, staking out territory and only giving it
away grudgingly. There were stories of them being so bold as to
steal babies off the backs of their mothers. To meet one down here
was the stuff of Jack's nightmares.

Shaking himself, Jack folded up the cuff of his left arm. It had
been rubbing against the graze he had taken freeing himself from
Rouger's manacles. He gave it a quick lick.

He was both lucky and unlucky that the water only made it halfway
up his calf. Lucky because, frankly, the less that actually touched
him, the better. Yet unlucky, because the stench was that much
worse when the water level was low.

He felt a tingling surge of panic begin to sour his stomach, but he
gritted his teeth and willed it back down. He told himself firmly
that he could handle this. He would adjust and he would keep
planning. Even if he had no help and no scrip or coin, he was still
free to leave town. The trick would be surviving after that. He
knew that he could not go to another town. What little he did know
about the malkemists told him that if he did not get far enough
away from the tracker, the tracker would run him down. If he went
to another town, the tracker might visit and pick up his trail.
Thinking on it, he did not know how they had found him so quickly,
but it lent credence to the stories he had heard of their skill.

He had no contacts outside of Corsisan. He had lived his entire
life until recently in the shanty town. If he was to survive, he
would have to find work in the country. He was clever enough to
know that trying to steal in a place he was not familiar with would
likely lead to disaster. He was a successful thief in Corsisan only
because he always knew it better than anyone who set out to catch
him. Anyone other than a malkemist that was. Malkemists did not
need to bother themselves with knowing the streets better than him.
They were cheaters.

Jack stopped still for a moment, pondering the ill-luck that had
dropped him into this dire situation. How was it that they could
find him at all? The silver? The box? He had left them behind in
Rouger's workroom. A chill spread up his spine and he grabbed the
crystal through the cloth of his coat, tucked away snugly in an
inner pocket. Could they follow the crystal? No. At least, he did
not think the crystal was necessary for them to follow him, there
must be a more foolproof way, since not everyone they tracked stole
something from them. He toyed briefly with the idea of dropping the
crystal right there and then in the urine and excrement laden
water flowing past his calves.

No. He would need something to sell if he hoped to survive. With
his mind made up he started moving again. He was close to the way
out he had decided to use.

There were two large sewer exits that emptied into rough earthen
channels in the shanty town, but it would be far too easy for the
malkemists to nab him there. He would be like a pigeon in the
sights of a slinger. As good as dead.

This was far better place, a quiet corner of the mud palaces.
There was even a well nearby he could wash up at, and then he would
make his way to the north road. The only problem was that there
would be women taking water from the well, and they might chase him
off.

As comfortable as he was in the dark, it was always a relief to be
able to use his eyes again, and he was feeling the slight
excitement of contact with the sun. A fleeting curl of the lip
played at the edge of his mouth.

Suddenly, a low, bass, growl filled the tunnel, setting off a
terrible echo. A second growl joined the first. Both were soft
sounds, but the menace was a clear as a bell.

Dogs. Jack hated dogs. But as much as he hated them, he feared them
more. He could not see them in the dark, but they were close, and
they were between him and his exit. He stepped backwards slowing
and carefully, his tongue still prickling with shock, wondering if
he should pull his knife, and if it would come to that.

Without warning a light flared to life behind him and Jack did
something that would give him goosebumps later.

He turned his back on the dogs.

Flinging an arm up to protect his eyes against the glare, he
squinted to make out who had sneaked up behind him.

Angrily his voice burst from him, "Who are you? What do you want?"

He was surprised at the lack of fear in his voice. Emboldened by the
strength he heard there, he gathered his wits to bluff himself free.

With disgust and simmering anger, the holder of the light cut him
off with a slightly muffled voice, "Shut up!"

Those two words would not have shut Jack up all by themselves, but
the delivery chilled any desire he had to cross the speaker. That
and the fact that the dogs had suddenly gone eerily silent.

"I swear, if you so much as kick up a droplet of this shit on me,
you'll have no place to sit for a week." The disembodied male voice
paused for a moment, "If you're thinking that's how you can get by
me, forget it. If I have to, I'll swim through this to catch you. I
won't like it, but I'll do it!"

The light source, Jack could not decide what it was, moved
dizzyingly for a moment as the bearer transferred it from a hand to
his chest somehow, giving Jack a quick glimpse of a bare,
black-haired head and scarf covered face.

<i>Not a malkemist?</i> Jack thought.

There was a metallic jangle as the man continued, "It won't come to
that will it? For one, you look like a smart kid. Second, Goss and
Boss back there will pull you down quicker than a lightning strike.

"Those two are crazy," he groused, and then continued, to Jack's
amazement, in an affectionate yet disgusted tone, "I think they
actually like it down here."

Jack flicked his head back around long enough to catch a glimpse of
two sets of very intent disembodied eyes glowing out at him from
the darkness, looking like anything but objects of affection.

The man held out something to Jack, and in a voice that had
returned to its ill $humour he instructed, "Clap those on kid."

When Jack did not immediately jump to obey, the man growled in
eerie mimicry of his pets.

Distinctly and slowly he said, "Put them on. Or it will hurt."

Jack did as he had been told. Noticing with dread that these were
much better shackles than the ones he had slipped in Rouger's
workroom. These shackles held his hands close together at the
front, and the man carefully turned Jack and encircled his waist
with two extra chains that fastened at Jack's back; preventing him
from lifting his arms from his waist.

Jack saw the two dogs clearly for the first time, and he took an
involuntary step back only to collide with the man fastening his
chains, earning him a painful push and tug.

They were monsters! Huge beasts with relentlessly intent and
pitiless stares. Jack felt like a cornered hare, and imagined a
challenge in their jutting postures.

<i>Run</i>, they urged. <i>Run. We'll give you a short lead
friend.</i>

Jack smelled mint. He turned to beg the man to let him go. He would
promise anything to be away from those dogs. He immediately felt a
cool wet mist puff into his face that caused him to give a panicked
cry and push away, only to fetch up short on the end of the chain
that was now attached to the man.

"Hold still idiot!" The man punctuated his growl with a flick of
knuckles to the side of Jack's head.

Jack got another puff of something to the face while he held his
breath and then several more around his person.

"What—" Jack began before he caught the implacable eyes of his
captor. The light shining brightly on his chest casting lurid
shadows over his eyes sockets and brows. As Jack's eyes slid away
from that gaze he noticed that the smell of mint was coming from
the scarf over the man's face.

"Let's go," ordered his masked captor, swinging Jack back $towards
the way he had come with surprising care and gentleness. Ruined by
the subsequent terse warning, "Don't kick anything up."

***

Jack had expected to be led above ground, but after the man
extinguished his light, he prodded Jack through the sewers in
darkness instead. He was not a talkative man, and the only
communication since Jack's capture had been the odd warning growl
whenever Jack's feet kicked up a splash.

Jack had heard nothing at all from the two giant beasts.

"We're here. Don't do anything stupid."

The light came back on, and Jack saw the hand and footholds that
led to a porthole above. He stepped $towards the first rung.

"Uh uh, you go last," said the man, pulling Jack up short with the
chain attached to Jack's waist and manacles.

Jack stepped back to let the man through, taking the moment to look
back for the dogs. They were gone. He swung his head around
nervously, just in case they had circled around, but he caught no
sight of them. They had vanished.

The chain connecting Jack to the man's waist was moving higher and
higher as the man climbed up the footholds, and then Jack heard
several dull thumps that sounded like the man's fist on the
porthole cover above.

Moments passed. The man thumped again. Jack could almost hear a
growl growing in the man, but before it could manifest, the
porthole cover suddenly pulled away and real light rushed down into the
sewer, forcing Jack to look away with a pained wince.

"Halme! You're late," came an unfamiliar male voice from above, the
tone mocking, not angry.

"Shut yer face," replied Halme more or less conversationally. His
rude response only elicited a nervous titter from the other man.

Jack forced himself to squint into the light, knowing that he had to
keep his wits about him. If an opportunity to escape presented
itself, he wanted to be able to see well enough to be able to take
it. However, as he did so he began to notice the most incredible
thing about his captor's boots and trousers. They were covered in
some shiny, shimmering substance. Transparent and wobbly. It
jiggled slightly each time Halme stepped to a new foothold. Jack's
curiosity was intense.

<i>What is that?</i>

He was so fascinated that he began climbing the rungs himself
without thinking. He was halfway up before he $realised that the
rungs under his hands were dry. Halme had not carried any of the
sewer out with him. Jack looked down past his own rolled up trouser
legs to confirm that his feet were wet.

They were definitely wet, and worse besides.

Halme was climbing out of the porthole already and Jack felt a tug
on his chain. The links cracking him behind the ear as Halme used
up all the slack.

"Hurry up!" Halme ordered.

Jack scurried up, the soft skin behind his ear smarting, and
emerged into a small private courtyard awash with daylight. The man
standing besides Halme wore a malkemist's pointed black hat, but
looked to be a shabby specimen of the type. Halme was half a head
taller, and bore himself much more proudly, despite the fact that
he had just crawled from a sewer.

Halme reached into his coat and withdrew a small glass ampule. He
touched it to each jiggling mass encasing his legs and feet, and to
Jack's astonishment, the mass was sucked in by the ampule. Within
two heartbeats it was as though they had never existed. Halme
replaced the ampule in his coat.

He then removed the scarf from his face, and Jack got his first
look at the man who had captured him. The colour of his eyes looked
funny somehow in the sunlight, in a way that Jack could not quite
put his finger on. His skin was tan, and his black moustache,
goatee, and narrow sideburns were sharp and immaculately groomed.

"Water," said Halme.

Jack was confused, but it was the malkemist who jumped to action,
moving to the private well and casting a pail into its depths. Jack
did a double take. These must be an extraordinarily wealthy people
to have a well in a private enclosed courtyard. Jack turned to see
the house. It was large and imposing, and fastidiously maintained.
The windows were glass, a rare extravagance. Even the royal
apartments on the hill did not have glass windows installed
throughout.

The pail was dumped unceremoniously beside Jack, water sloshing
over the sides, and Jack took to it tentatively, cupping water to
rinse his legs below the knee.

"Catch!"

  Jack looked up just in time to catch a fresh bar of soap. He
sniffed at it suspiciously. He had seen soap before, just not so
much of it, and none scented like this one. The rare worn down
remnants he had used still smelled a little like the animal they
came from. Nevertheless, he lathered his legs, losing the bar
several times in the process. It might have disappeared down into
the sewer, if not for the fact that Halme had knocked the porthole
cover back into place moments before.

While Jack was rinsing soap from his legs, Halme reached into his
coat and withdrew a compact wad of black cloth. He gave it a
peculiar shake and in the next instant he had a malkemist's hat in
hand. He gave it two ostentatious and quite unnecessary dustings
before placing the pointed hat on his head.

Jack eyed him warily, though he had been almost completely sure he
was a malkemist the moment he saw the jelly around his legs. Halme
raised an eyebrow, but said nothing.

By the time Jack was clean, and most of the smell of the sewer gone,
the less distinguished malkemist had disappeared inside the large
house. Halme was quiet, but did not seem exceptionally put out or
impatient in any way.

"Let's go," he said, gesturing in an unexpectedly cordial manner.

There was no use in struggling. Halme was a big man, and the chain
between them was proof against any evasions that Jack might try, so
he entered the house through the indicated open double door. Halme
closed the door behind them, and then to Jack's surprise,
unfastened his chains and shackles. Before Jack could think to take
advantage, he was propelled through another door into a waiting
audience.

Jack froze as soon as his feet came to rest. In front of him was a
corpulent malkemist in a chair large enough to be a throne. The fat
man radiated disgust and made annoyed shooing sounds and gestures
$towards Jack as soon as he caught his balance. It took Jack a few
moments to $realise that he was standing on a rug. He stepped off
gingerly, trying to keep his eyes down.

"Keep your monkey off the expensive ones, soldier!" scolded the fat
man.

"He's your monkey, Master Nuth, not mine. I just fetched him for
you," replied Soldier Halme.

There was silence for a moment, and Jack risked a glance upwards to
see Master Nuth glaring across the room at Halme. The sight
reminded him of Sadel, and Jack decided that the man was dangerous
straight away. The master's eyes rolled up and to the right
theatrically, and he flicked his hand out into space as though
ridding himself of some clinging morsel of food.

He demanded peevishly, "Well, does he have it?"

"He did," replied Halme unhelpfully. A few moments passed before he
pulled something from his pocket in an unhurried manner and tossed
it to the shabby malkemist from outside, who promptly threatened to
drop it amid several sharply indrawn breaths.

"Oh by the Prime Imaginer, why I allow you to stay Malkum! Give it
here now!" exclaimed the master in disgust.

"Yes sirness, sorry sirness," mumbled Malkum as he made his way to
the master, almost tripping on the rug as he went. Jack heard a
snigger from one of the other malkemists in the room, of which he
counted only three that had not been introduced.

The master's eyes glittered with avarice as he received the crystal
into his fat fingered grasp. Though he remembered himself enough to
wave Malkum off with irritation when the man remained to hover.

"It's beautiful," he gushed, seeming to lose himself in a moment of
genuine pleasure. Yet his rapture was short lived, because his
attention soon returned to Jack. He fixed the boy with a coyish
look from beneath a lowered brow. The look may have worked for him
in his youth, but the effect now was little short of disturbing.

"My rival would probably have your entrails out by now, stomping on
them with petty relish! You've quite lucky I found you first," he
declared self indulgently. He directed his next question rhetorically
to everyone in the room, "But what am I going to do with him?"

With barely a pause he answered himself, "You didn't steal from me.
And, truth be told, your escapades have enriched me to the
detriment of my enemy. A most happy happenstance."

He smiled in a terribly self-satisfied way, like a man who has won
a contest and knows that there will be no rematch to even the
score.

"But," he continued, "what's the expression Pravil?"

He turned to the trio of malkemists to his right, seated by the
long table, but did not wait for a response, "If you prick one, we
all bleed?"

He chuckled, thinking it was a splendid joke, and indeed, there
were several smirks.

Jack took the moment to shift his body slightly and turn to look at
Halme behind him. The man's face was impassive, but Jack turned
back without having taken special notice of his $demeanour.

"Unfortunately, my hands as you no doubt see, are tied. I will do
you to courtesy of making it quite clean and painless. You do
deserve..." he never got to finish the thought.

Jack sprang backwards and collided with Halme, twisting into the
man's grasp while his quick fingers worked the man's coat. Halme
pushed him off almost immediately, but Jack did not mind at all.
As he spun free he raised a pilfered vial triumphantly into the
air.

"Get back!" he screamed in warning. "Or I'll blow us all to hell!"

A stunned silence descended on the room. Not the fearful silence
that Jack had expected, more a speculative silence, a weighing
silence. Jack did not like it one bit. He had positioned himself on
the rug, far enough from everyone else in the room that they could
not possibly grab him before he cast the vial. No one seemed
concerned that his feet were once more soiling the floor coverings.

"I said, I'll blow us all to hell!" reiterated Jack, in what he
hoped was a clearer voice.

"Oh, we heard you boy. But what, exactly, do..." the master began.

Fate it seemed was not content to allow Master Nuth the opportunity
to finish his sentences. An arm wrapped around Jack's chest and
another grabbed at his raised arm. Convulsively he threw the vial
down before it could be trapped. It sped from his hand, but at the
same time Jack had plenty of time to appreciate that he was still
not being taken seriously. With the vial released, the malkemists
did not react with fear or panic. They were laughing. He used up
the moment before impact wondering what it was they knew that he
did not. That, and squeezing his eyes tightly shut.

Boom! It was a gloriously satisfying sound to Jack's ears. It was
also an order of magnitude louder than he had expected. So loud,
that he was momentarily struck dumb by it. He only barely heard the
cry of alarm from the person holding him as he or she released him.
He felt multiple bites on his legs and arms, and as the thunder of
the explosion itself receded a cacophony of raised voices and
curses.

Jack opened his eyes on pandemonium.

Malkum, bless his subservient heart, had thrown himself selflessly
over Master Nuth in an admirable attempt to shield the latter.
Unfortunately, it did not seem to have protected the master one
jot, as his face had gotten in the way of the same biting stings
that had landed on Jack's legs. One cut under his right eye looked
particularly nasty. The master's initial surprise and pain were
quickly giving way to annoyance and then anger as Malkum struggled
ineffectually to get up and remove the burden of himself from his
master.

Of the three malkemists by the long table, two were rolling around
on the ground clutching at themselves, but the third was on his
feet, encased from head to foot in the same substance Jack had seen
Halme use in the sewer.

The rug was a disaster. A three foot circular section had been
obliterated, revealing the stone floor, now streaked with what
looked like white powder and surrounded by singed and blackened
$fibres.

The person who had grabbed Jack from behind turned out to be a
woman, and she was staring in shock at the hole in the rug,
uncaring of the droplets of blood that had begun to well through
the cuts on her face and arms

Jack's gaze swung to Halme, only to find the soldier already
watching him as he rose from a kneeling pose. He alone seemed
unaffected by the explosion. They held each other's eye for several
moments.

Jack tried anyway.

Jack had played this game with the town guards on several
occasions. He would first run straight at them offering his arm as
an easy target for capture. Then, when the guard tried to take hold of
him by the arm, he would spin opposite the thumb of the grip and
already be far enough beyond to be impossible to catch. Simple yet
effective.

Halme did not take the arm, nor did he grab at Jack's coat. Jack
could already see that things had gone pear-shaped, but he
continued on by attempting to spin around Halme nonetheless, even
though the man had not committed himself and was in no way
unbalanced. The soldier simply stepped in at the last moment and
took Jack around the waist. A moment of struggle later, and he had
both of Jack's arms pinned to his sides.

Master Nuth had been cursing throughout, but his voice reached a
crescendo as he rolled poor Malkem ignominiously to the floor with a
thud.

"What the hell was in that vial Soldier Halme?!" Master Nuth
demanded in an indecorous screech.

"Mint."

"What?! Talk sense man!"

"It was a simple scent. Mint."

"That's impossible! Did you confuse your store?" queried Nuth, his
tone implying the worst of anyone who could do such a thing.

But Halme was equanimous in the face of the accusation, "No, I just
finished using it. It was the scent of mint. The vill was
distinctive. I $recognised it in the boy's hand.

Voices had begun to call out from other parts of the house and
footsteps were pounding down the hall. Faces appeared at the door,
taking in the ruin of the rug and the general disorder. Master Nuth
subsided back into his gigantic chair with an equally gigantic
huff.

He gestured in mild disgust at his rug with an open hand, but the
best he could articulate was a meaningless expletive, "Urgh!"

"Varlay, get him out of here." said Master Nuth, but after a moment
he continued more specifically, "Put him in the holding room. And
keep him chained. I need to consider this."

Halme simply nodded and manhandled Jack through the gathering
spectators, his hands like bands of steel around Jack's upper arms.

***

The soldier marched Jack to his cell and propelled him into the
room before locking the door with a thrown bolt from the outside.
Jack managed to keep his feet.

Jack was alone, and he was also unchained. This puzzled him, but
since the lone window was a series of slats that only let light and
air into the room, and the door was locked, he saw little
advantage.

Jack almost laughed when he took stock of his situation more
thoroughly and $realised that a holding room for a malkemist meant
the height of luxury for him. There was a bed with actual feathers,
a chair, and desk. A basin of water had been hauled to the room and
there was a refuse bucket. Without the threat of death hanging over
his head, he would have been thanking his lucky stars.

Snot and Hat would be wondering where he had gotten to by now,
since he was usually back to their room long before they went out
to beg, but they would not think it too strange. It would be when
he did not show up before sunset that everyone would start to
worry. Jack had never failed to come home. They would be right to
worry.

A sudden thought struck him. What if Stine went to Marten to see if
he had any word of Jack? Would Marten have any reason to land Stine
in hot water? He just hoped that they worried quietly among
themselves rather than trying to track him down.

There was nothing that Jack could do at present, so he washed his
face and curled up on the bed. At first the softness disconcerted
him and he felt mildly anxious about being swallowed by its soft
folds. He imagined telling Snot and Hat about such a bed, a bed big
enough for all three of them to sleep on. He smiled thinking about
it. The very next thing he knew there was a scrape, followed by the
door closing and the clunk of the bolt being locked once more. Jack
was up in a moment, bleary-eyed, only to see that a tray of food
had been deposited by the door.

He $realised that he must have slept afterall, and from the
sunlight streaming through the slats of his window, well past
midday. Padding to the door he fell upon the tray with ravenous
delight. Freshly baked bread, a slice of cheese, and lentil soup.
He scarfed down the fare as quickly as he could get it into his
mouth, which led quite quickly to a painful block in his
$oesophagus. He cleared it by forcing it down with some water and
then ate more slowly. He finished the entire tray while squatting
in front of the door.

Satiated, he washed his face and went back to the bed. As he lay
there pondering how he might get used to a bed like this, he fell
asleep yet again.

***

Jack was running, running from yowls and yaps that persued him down
endless lengths of stone tunnel. Strangely he could see each $grey
stone perfectly and the redish-brown mortar that helped the tunnel
forbid the crushing weight of the earth above. The floor of the
tunnel was completely bare and clean. Not a drop of water lay on
the ground, yet he still felt like his legs were dragging through a
thick liquid. The dogs behind him were gaining ground every moment,
their noisy pursuit growing louder and louder. The closer they
drew, the harder it was to run. Soon, he had slowed so badly that
he was barely moving forward at all and panic gripped his heart. No
matter how hard he pushed his feet, he could not make them move
faster; he could barely make them move at all. His legs began to
ache with the effort it took to drive them forward. That's when he
saw the malkemist ahead, tall and dark. While everything else was
bright and clear, the malkemist was shrouded in shadow, his face
hidden.

With a flick of the wrist the malkemist struck Jack with a
well-aimed globule of liquid. It hit his sternum and spread like
wildfire around his body, encasing his legs and feet in the same
thick and jiggling liquid he had seen on the soldier Halme. It did
not stop there though. Instead, it climbed to his neck and then
cascaded down his arms, $immobilising every muscle it touched. It
slithered its slow way up his neck, cool and slimey to the touch.
It covered his ears, his lower jaw, and mounted the back of his
neck to finally cover every strand of hair on his head.

Then, as Jack's heart beat harder and harder in his chest, and the
baying of the dogs reached a cresendo that he could hear even
through the liquid over his ears, he opened his mouth to scream. As
though waiting for just that signal to pounce, the liquid rushed in
and smothered him, cutting off his breath. He struggled and pushed,
but his muscles would not move. His eyes could not even open
against the slime over his face. It was going to smother him to
death and no one would know how he had died.

***

Jack's eyes flew opened in darkness and he struggled to draw
breath, but air would not enter his mouth or nose. A great weight
pressed down on his body, and though he struggled, he could not sit
up against it.

He felt something shift on his face, and suddenly he could breath
through his nose again; just barely. Through the last vestiges of
sleep and the panic of suffocation, his brain $recognized the scent
of mint as air thundered in and out of his nose.

"Shh. I'm taking you out, but you'll need to be quiet. Swallow if
you understand," spoke a calm quiet voice very close to Jack's ear.

Jack dutifully swallowed, and was rewarded with the slow withdrawal
of the meaty palm that had been covering his mouth, and then the
man's body. Jack could not help taking a thorough deep breath that
stretched his chest. Unsurprisingly, he was wide awake.

"Stay close to me and I can guarantee that you'll live through the
next two days at least, but I'll need you to want to live,"
whispered Halme.

Jack nodded stupidly in the semi-dark, noticing that the sun had
set and precious little light was coming in through the window. He
was about to grunt in acknowledgment when Halme continued.

"Good. We should get going then."

Jack could only puzzle briefly over how Halme could see him in the
gloom because the man was already at the door and inching it open.
Light streamed in from outside and silhouetted Halme as he quickly
checked that no one was in the hall outside. Jack was by him in a
moment.

"Are we going into the sewer again?" Jack asked in a whisper.

Halme rolled his eyes in exasperation and fixed Jack with an
intense look.

"First, keep your mouth shut," he answered in a whisper that was
louder than Jack's own, "and second, no, we won't be going into the
sewer."

This malkemist was irritatingly arrogant and Jack felt the impulse
to show him up somehow.

"You going to put me in shackles?" Jack asked insolently.

"What? No!" whispered back the soldier, "I'm here to get you out,
how would shackles help numbskull?!"

He noticed how close Jack was to him suddenly and hissed, "Stay
away from my coat, the next time you pull a vill from me it'll be
with broken fingers."

"The next time I pull a..." Jack retorted, but Halme had already
crept too far down the hall for him to hear, forcing Jack to
swallow the retort while he rushed to keep up. He noticed with an
uncomfortable stirring of respect that Halme moved very quietly. He
would make an excellent thief.

The sentiment faded somewhat when he $realised that Halme basically
intended to walk out the way they had come in. At each footfall he
expected an alarm to be raised, or their way blocked by a bevy of
malkemists. By the time they were within yards of the double doors
to the rear courtyard, Jack was scratching at hives and thinking
that everything was going far too smoothly. It could not be so
simple. He felt disaster practically breathing down his neck.

They slipped out the back door and walked across the courtyard to
the large gate that guarded the back wall of the house. There was
a small post built into the wall, and within, a guard. At last,
Halme's plan was going to hit a snag.

But as they walked boldly up to the guard post, it became quite
obvious that the guard was soundly asleep. Jack almost snorted in
disgust. Halme gave the oblivious guard a smart salute and let
himself out the back gate. He then gave Jack a flowery sweeping bow
and flourish as he exited the postern, the type that might be
reserved for a visiting noble. Jack frowned furiously at the
mockery, his cheeks heating, but fortunately he was much more
concerned about the rider in the alley to take it too much to
heart.

Halme signalled the rider to approach, then turned to Jack and said
in a voice completely devoid of remorse, "I'm sorry about this my
boy."

He sprayed Jack square in the face with the same mist he had used
down in the sewers, following almost exactly the same pattern as
before.

Jack snorted angrily, which only caused Halme to chuckle.

"What was that for?!" Jack demanded in a whisper.

"Sorry, no time for questions, we have to get going," Halme harried.
"You will have to ride with me."

Jack opened his mouth to protest, but Halme scooped him up by the
waist and one leg and threw him bodily upon the horse as the
waiting rider trotted up with her. There was no leather saddle, as
was common for most mounts that Jack had seen, just a riding
blanket. Jack noticed that the hooves of the horses were curiously
muffled. Halme was up behind Jack in a moment. The other rider
released the reins of his horse and rode on ahead.

Meanwhile Jack was squeezing his legs and holding on for dear life.
He had never been this close to a horse before, let alone touching
or riding one. Even at a walk, Jack could feel the terrifying power
of the creature.

Then, after some subtle urging by Halme, it began to trot and the
true torture began. He braced his hands in terrified $rigour over
the horse's withers, and at each jarring pace he had to tense his
legs and arms to avoid being sawn in half. Or at least, that is how
it felt. Within a few minutes he was exhausted.

He certainly had no resources left over to determine where they
were going, though he was desperately interested in knowing.
Halme would occasionally jostle him back to $centre when he
threatened to slide off either side.

To Jack's immense relief the ride was blessedly short. In the end,
they pulled into a stable that was ready and waiting for them, and
the stable doors closed smoothly on their heels. Jack had
completely failed to gain his bearings.

He tried to throw himself off the horse almost immediately, but
Halme kept him in his seat, such as it was, until he himself had
slid off. When Jack finally made the ground, his legs could hardly
support him. He found the way Halme was smiling at him almost
intolerable. His scowl was at risk of becoming permanent.

"Follow me, you should meet your rescuer," Halme said to Jack, and
then to their fellow rider, "Are you coming up Melanie?"

Jack started slightly at discovering the other rider was a woman.
She had ridden the entire way with reckless speed. Jack concluded
that she must be an extraordinarily bold and fearless woman to be
effecting escapes from malkemist compounds.

"No, I'll talk to him later."

"Varlay," replied Halme amicably.

"After you urchin," he said to Jack, indicating for Jack to go in
first.

From the stable they passed through a narrow corridor of stone
into a large kitchen. The smells coming from an equally large stove
were heavenly, but Halme seemed to have no interest in the food.
From the kitchen, they entered a large foyer. Jack eyed the front
door, but followed Halme's lead when he pointed to the staircase.
Jack's legs complained on the stairs, burning in uncomfortable
places with each step. However his physical discomfort was
completely forgotten when he reached the landing. Scalp tingling,
the distinctive smell hit him as he stared down the hall.

He knew this hallway. He had been here only last night. The
wall-mounted lamp glowed merrily, as though welcoming him back.

Halme rested a gentle hand on Jack's shoulder.

"In you go," he said, gesturing to the study on the right.

"You tricked me!" Jack hissed emphatically, feeling shocked and
betrayed.

"I tricked a lot of people today, but relax, I think I left you
out. This doesn't mean what you're thinking it means."

He tried to pat Jack's shoulder, but Jack pulled back sharply.
Halme snorted in amusement.

"In you go," he repeated, an edge of the implacable in his voice.

Jack entered the study more ashamed than scared. He had been
$outmanoeuvred on a grand scale and thoroughly thrashed on his home
turf. He heard Halme follow him in and close the door, but Jack
could not lift his eyes from the floor.

"He seems more bashful than I expected," opined an unfamiliar
voice.

"Never fear, he has his moments," replied Halme.

"The plith crystal?"

"Here," Halme affirmed, moving forward.

Jack snuck a peek from beneath his lowered brow as Halme deposited
the crystal in the other man's hand. He was a little taller than
Halme.

"That's wonderful," he said with obvious relief, "perfect."

Halme went and sat in a plush chair by one of the bookcases. He
nonchalantly knocked his knuckles against the top of a small end
table by the chair and a hidden platform rose into view, filled
with crystal glassware and a whiskey decanting stand.

A solid silver decanting stand.

The soldier caught Jack's eye with a crass lack of tact and idly
stroked the silverware with a knowing smirk before pouring himself
off some refreshment.

Jack was so engrossed that he missed some of what the tall man was
saying.

"... of what you saw?"

"Absolutely Master Amoth, there's no mistaking what happened. The
only question is why," replied Halme.

Master Amoth considered Jack, and then asked "Well Jack, what do
you think happened?

"Of course I know your name," he said, responding to Jack's look of
surprise, "Your goldsmith friend was hardly the soul of
discretion."

"I don't know what you're talking about," Jack said.

"You don't remember setting off a rapid expander under Master
Nuth's nose?"

"Oh, you mean the boom?"

Amoth smiled, "What a quaint vernacular. Yes, the boom."

Jack shugged, "I just threw it."

Master Amoth shared a look with Halme, then turned back in time to
see Jack eyeing the window.

"You'll excuse me if I took the precaution of locking the
shutters," he smiled wryly, "it was an impressive jump, but I do
not want to see it repeated."

Jack examined the floor instead.

"Do you have someone who can send him up-country?" asked Halme.

Amoth looked up sharply, "You can't do it?"

"I didn't reveal myself to the Reds. I will go back tonight."

"Really?! That's good news! You're much more valuable there. But
how did you manage it?"

Halme grinned, "I set a rapid expander in the boy's window slats. A
boom. They'll be thinking you tracked him with your terrifying
powers and plucked him from their holding cell. The dummy plith
should have dissolved by now too, so that'll be another mystery for
them."

The tall man laughed delightedly.

"I want to go home," said Jack softly, as the laughter settled
down.

The two men shared another meaningful glance.

"There's a couple of reasons you can't go back for now Jack,"
explained Master Amoth. "For one, Master Nuth will pick up your
trace as soon as the masking villend wears off, and I don't see him
forgetting about you in a hurry. Second ..."

"The masking what?" Jack interrupted.

Master Amoth took a deep and slightly unsteady breath, as though
gathering himself to make a complex or possibly duplicitous
explanation, but Soldier Halme beat him to it.

"Come here lad," he beckoned conspiratorially, his eyes earnest.

Jack approached hesitantly, his eyes on the soldier's coat lining
as he opened it.

"Closer, closer," he urged, opening the coat some more and...
spraying him full in the face with the same liquid he had used
on Jack twice already.

Jack snorted in annoyance and backed off quickly, glaring at the
soldier.

Halme shrugged off Jack's indignation and smiled smugly, "Well, you
asked. That's masking villend. It obscures the signature of a
person or object that a tracking villend uses to find them.
Unfortunately, the mask only works for a couple of hours. Half a
day at most."

"Obviously," elaborated Amoth, "we cannot let Nuth get his chubby
and ill-bred fingers on you, so we'll send you to a safe place to
lie low. You can't risk telling anyone that we are getting you out
of town, because it would place them in danger. Imagine what might
happen to them if they spoke that kind of thing into the wrong
ear."

Master Amoth waited for acknowledgement from Jack before he
continued. Jack nodded slowly.

"I will $organise transport and protection for you to get to
safety. Not even Master Nuth would dare pursue you where I'm
sending you."

"Why are you helping me?" asked Jack, "I stole from you."

"Well, technically, you only borrowed from me, as I have recovered
everything that you took. Other than that, you can consider it my
great pleasure to thwart any ardent desire of the reprobate Master
Nuth," answered Master Amoth, though Jack noticed that he answering
nothing at all.

Halme climbed out of his plush chair suddenly and bid Master Amoth
goodnight.

"No game?" asked Master Amoth, eyes eager.

"No, I don't have time," Halme replied with regret.

Winking at Jack, he was almost out the door before Master Amoth
called out for him to send Emily up.

When Emily, a mousy woman in a brown dress, poked her head around
the door a minute later, Master Amoth waved her in.

"Emily, meet Jack. Jack, Emily," he introduced efficiently. "Emily
will settle you in Jack."

It was a dismissal.

Emily wasted no time leading Jack out, but as the door closed,
Master Amoth called through the narrowing gap.

"Remember what I said Jack. Contacting anyone you know will put
them in grave danger."

"This way, Jack," Emily instructed, descending the stairs. "Would
you like a bath?"

Jack shook his head $vigourously, all the while wondering when the
best time to slip out of the house would present itself.

"Varley, relax," she reassured, though somewhat disgustedly, "it's
your choice.

"I'll introduce you to Minnie first, then show you to your room. I
don't know you, so I'm going to warn you straight up, whether you
need it or not. Don't talk back to Minnie, even if you think she's
saying the craziest bobble you've ever heard," she paused a moment,
"Master Amoth himself doesn't correct Minnie or tell her what to
do, understood?"

Jack just nodded.

He almost took an involuntary step backwards when he caught sight
of Minnie. She was the largest woman he had ever seen. She had her
back to them as they entered, and though she was on the other side
of a large bench, he still had trouble shaking the impression of
physical menace. Jack was used to almost everyone he interacted
with being bigger than him, but this was different. For several
moments he tried to imagine that he had somehow missed the sight of
her as he passed through the kitchen earlier. He quickly convinced
himself that such a thing was impossible.

"Minnie, I have another mouth for you to feed," Emily called.

Minnie looked over her shoulder with the distracted air of someone
who was concentrating and just wants the peace to continue doing
so.

"Wait," she called back in a deep and husky voice that still
managed to sound feminine.

Moments later she swung around and fixed her eyes on Jack, and the
first words out of her mouth were, "What is it?"

Emily tried to answer, but Minnie was answering her questions for
herself. Thank you very much.

"A dirty street rat! Why is it in my beautiful kitchen? Who thought
it was a good idea to bring this filth into my kitchen? Ah, that
Master Amoth, that's who. Never a care for putting me out that
one."

Seeing Jack's mounting terror, she continued.

"I'm sure it isn't your fault poor one, you're likely an innocent
in all of this. It is Master Amoth's doing for sure.  Minnie could
I have duck tonight? Minnie, why can't I eat your orange flan out
of season? Minnie, feed my guests at odd hours? And now this! A
filthy beggar in my kitchen. No offense my boy. It's too much! I
have the want to march right up those stairs and give him a piece
of my mind! But then, that wouldn't solve the problem of this dirty
rat in my kitchen would it? No. It'd probably just make it worse!
That's what I'm thinking. He's gone and dumped this problem in my
lap like it's my job to clean every filthy thing that traipses into
this house. I never had this trouble with his father. That was a
respectful and gentle sirness if ever there was one."

Minnie kept going. There was little in the way of pause as she
moved around the room punctuating her more forceful points with
thrusts of the ladle in her hand. She pulled a brass banded tub,
which looked to be at least double Jack's weight from the wall with
not so much as a feigned grunt for Jack's peace of mind.

"I was boiling this water for something else, but I see I have to
sacrifice it for the greater good now," she sighed.

She pulled a large pot from the stove and swung it with uncanny
dexterity from side to side as she walked it across the room to the
tub. She emptied all forty odd lits into the tub, then scooped more
from a standing reservoir in the corner.

She tested the water with a sausage-like finger.

"Good enough. Now for the salts."

She fetched a small wooden barrel and threw a handful of white
powder into the water, then repeated this from another barrel.

She advanced on Jack ominously. He looked around for support from
Emily, only to $realise that Emily had left the room and closed the
door to the foyer behind her. Too late Jack decided to dodge.

Minnie's powerful right hand caught Jack by the scruff of the neck
and he became as compliant as a bunny within the blink of an eye.
She flicked his hat off, stripped him of his coat, and made
similarly short work of his trousers and shirt. Minnie's $monologue
did not falter throughout.

"... you go, just as nature intended..."

She dropped him bodily into the tub and he yowled in anguish as the
hot water scalded his skin. He tried to rise, but she just forced
him back into the water.

"... best keep your complaints to yourself..."

She took to him with a boar bristle brush from nowhere. The boar
must have been a monster, because each stroke threatened to tear
skin off. He mewled piteously, but Minnie was pitiless and
merciless in the face of his torment.

When she scrubbed behind his ear, he tried to fend off the sharp
bristles, but that only earned him a painful crack to the head with
the wooden backside. Minnie was evidently not one to be casually
thwarted.

"... lovely shade of pink you've come up..."

She repeatedly pushed his head under the water while he panicked,
yet he dared not resist. Once his hair was clean, she rubbed oiled
fingers through his hair roughly, then brushed it through with a
fine silver comb.  Once it was unknotted, she trimmed his hair with
quick deft cuts of a pair of scissors that seemed to have
$materialised out of nowhere. A literal first for Jack, who had
only ever had his hair hacked off with a knife.

"Out you jump," she ordered.

Emily was back, but Jack was not bashful about being naked in front
of anyone. She was holding up pants and a shirt made of the same
material. They looked nowhere near as sturdy as his own beloved
clothing, lying discarded on the wet floor.

"$Pyjamas!" exclaimed Emily, "A little big, but we can shorten the
legs and arms."

Minnie was using a brass scraper she called a strigil to slough off
the water that clung to his body, and then began toweling Jack dry
as gently as she was able, which is to say, not gently at all. In
one final indignity she puffed scented powder in his face, behind
his ears, and between his toes, before releasing him to climb into
the flimsy baby-blue $pyjamas.

While Emily fussed at his cuffs, pinning the hems of his pants so
that the new hem hung just above his heel, he was forced to admit
to himself that he smelled quite nice.

"... whip you up something to eat."

Then something extraordinary happened. Minnie stopped speaking. At
the stove she was as silent as the grave, but Jack had no time to
puzzle over the change because Emily demanded most of his
attention.

"Sit down and I'll finish this off for now with a basting stitch so
you're not tripping over yourself," Emily offered.

Jack sat on a stool by the central bench and watched in fascination
as Emily threaded a needle with deft movements. She then knotted
the thread and clipped the small excess with a tiny pair of shears.

Kneeling by his leg, she poked the needle from the inside to the
outside and pulled the thread through until it caught on the knot.
Then with quick, economical movements, she ran the needle through
four or five folds of the material at a time before pulling the
thread through to reveal multiple, near perfect stitches.

As she worked, her cool hands incidentally bumped the sensitive
skin on the top of Jack's feet. Sometimes a light brush, at others
a rougher contact. All the while Jack stared down in mute
fascination, his head cocked bird-like to the side. A strange
feeling was growing somewhere between his belly button and his
nipples, a place where he was only used to feeling stabs of anxiety
and panic. It spread like a dull warm glow from his $centre and
infused every limb. He imagined blue butterflies perched delicately
on the two twists of hair she kept at the sides of her head to keep
it up and out of her face.

He was completely infatuated with her by the time she finished the
second hem.

Minnie slid a wooden tray across the bench to Jack. It held a bowl
of soup and two thick slices of bread.

"Butter?" queried Minnie.

"Butter?" Jack repeated dumbly.

"Yes, Butter. Do you want butter?"

"I guess."

"I guess what?" challenged Minnie crossly.

"I guess... so?" replied Jack in confusion.

"Please! Say please!"

"Please," Jack said promptly.

Minnie seemed poorly satisfied, but she quickly conjured up two
slabs of pale yellow something, which Jack naturally assumed must
be butter, and deposited on the lightly toasted bread.

Jack, never a fussy eater, bit down on the bread and butter, and
was rewarded by the best tasting bread he had ever eaten. The
slightly salty butter, with its satisfying fatty texture completed
the bread in a way that exceeded his narrow expectations of bread.

"No! No! No! That's no way to eat. I didn't clean you up so you
could eat like a pig at a trough. You're going to soil those nice
$pyjamas Miss Emily went to the trouble of getting for you. You're
making me regret not drowning your sorry butt in the tub. Eat like
a gentleman, or there will ..."

Minnie kept going, but Jack had stopped eating. He put his hands at
his sides and just sat there; a torn but unchewed piece of bread
poking out from the side of his mouth.

"... there is no need to stop eating boy, just eat slowly. I've
never seen a child eat like ..."

Jack ventured a slow bite at the bread that was already in his
mouth, then another with his hands still by his sides.

"... with your mouth open, do you think anyone here wants to see
what's going on in your stomach? Close your yapper when you chew. I
will slap the uncouth out of ..."

He closed his mouth and swallowed. Hesitantly he reached for
another piece of bread.

"... the soup first boy! You can't finish the bread before you've
even tasted the soup. Here take this spoon and ..."

Minnie took the solid silver spoon from the side of the tray,
polished it absently with her apron, and skimmed some soup;
scooping from front to back.

"... the way to eat soup ..."

She then put it to Jack's lips to sip. It was delicious!

"... your turn. Mind you don't spill it on yourself. Sip over the
bowl, not your lap..."

Jack took the proffered spoon and scooped and sipped as he had been
shown. It was frustrating, but the taste more than made it worth
his while.

"Here, drink your kefir," said Minnie, pushing a crystal glass his
way, filled with what looked like milk.

Milk was a very rare treat for Jack, so he reached for it
immediately. He jerked in surprise as the taste of the kefir filled
his mouth, sour and clean. Though he had been expecting the mild
taste of milk, this new taste grew on him quickly.

Emily had a big smile on her face as she watched Minnie
alternatively scold and instruct Jack in the niceties of tableside
ettiquette. For some reason, that made it much more enjoyable for
Jack. He was not smiling, but he was not miserable either. He had
just eaten some of the fatty duck in the soup and he was honestly
wondering how anyone could possibly make such perfect food.

"... now comes the best part, and certainly it will appeal to your
natural inclination. Dip the bread into the soup and eat it
like..."

Jack did as instructed, though he had certainly mastered this skill
long ago. Minnie kept talking. She seemed not to stop when she was
excited. Within a short span the meal was finished, and Minnie
prompted him for, and got, a "thank you."

Jack yawned mightily.

"... cover your mouth when you..."

He nodded sleepily.

"Varlay Jack, I think it's time to show you to your bed. Goodnight
Minnie," said Emily.

Jack was so sleepy that he did not even try to palm the silverware
as Emily urged him out of his seat. Nor did he hear anything else
that Minnie may have said. A part of his awareness told him that he
should not be so sleepy, since he had slept most of the day away,
but the rest of him did not care. In short order he was in a bed
even more luxurious than the one he had slept in during the day.
Emily had made him wash his hands and wash his mouth out with salty
water, and then tucked him into a bed with actual sheets and a
blanket.

***

He dreamed of unexpected puffs of wet mist in his face.

***

Jack woke to the sensation of falling a bare instant before he hit
the floor with a thud. It took him several moments to remember
exactly where he was, though he could only narrow it down to the
malkemist's home. He did not remember going to sleep very clearly
at all. More embarrassed than hurt, he was just thankful that no
one was around to see him struggle to kick himself free of his
tangled blanket.

The bed he had just fallen from was suspended on a frame just
higher than his knee, which in light of what had just happened, he
did not think was a particularly inspired design.

As he stood up he $realised two things. First, that there was light
streaming through the slats of the shuttered window, telling him
that he had slept unusually long. And second, that he really needed
to pee.

He looked around the room for the bucket that should be there for
the purpose, but there was no bucket. In the mudbrick palaces, he
used a dilapidated pail that was always threatening to fall apart
and escape its lowly role, but which never actually gave up the
ghost. In the shanty town he had done his business directly into an
open air latrine from a rickety platform suspended above it on thin
poles.

Here there was nothing. It seemed while his other circumstances
were slowly improving, this particular aspect was deteriorating. A
latrine was no work for him, but a bucket meant work, as he was
generally the one who had to empty it.

Now he could not go at all. Surely malkemists had a better way.

He hurriedly opened the door and stepped out. Fortunately he
$recognised the foyer from there and immediately rushed to the
kitchen. Minnie looked up as he entered. He jiggled up-and-down and
from side-to-side, completely discarding his dignity, and was
rewarded with a vague gesture $towards the stables.

He rushed down the short connecting corridor and noticed another
door that he had not seen on his way into the house. It seemed like
a much more likely place to keep a latrine than a stable, so he
took it, and was relieved that it led outside into a relatively
narrow courtyard, only a dozen feet wide, but three times as long.
There was a raised flower bed by the side of the house, a pile of
refuse, a tiny wooden house at the far end, and a well by the door.
But nowhere could he see what he needed. In the end, and in
desperation, he stepped up on the low stone wall of the raised bed
and whizzed among some pretty yellow flowers. His relief was
intense.

"I wouldn't let Minnie catch you doing that. Those are her
flowers," said Master Amoth as he exited from the tiny house at the
end of the courtyard. Jack froze.

"The toilet is free," he said, thumbing over his shoulder at the
tiny house as he passed Jack by.

Jack finished up uneasily. He decided he would investigate what
this "toilet" was later.

Back in the kitchen Minnie turned on him immediately, "Wash your
hands! Goodness knows what you touched"

To Jack's surprise, those words were not the beginning of a tirade.
She was busy beating at something in a bowl, and it seems to
consume all of her concentration. He vaguely remembered the basin
at which he had washed his hands the night before and used it.

He approached the stool, but before he could sit, Minnie ordered
him off to fetch water and pushed a pail into his arms.

It took him over twenty pulls at the well to fill the kitchen
reservoir, but it was relatively easy work, since his hands were
already toughened and callused from similar work.

When he finished, Minnie served him up a delicious breakfast of
buttered toast and fried eggs that he demolished in short order,
along with a condiment that Minnie called her special chutney. He
was used to watered porridge for breakfast, sometimes more water
than porridge, and he decided that he could get used to this new
fare quite quickly. Although he did spare a thought for Snot and
Hat, who were no doubt eating porridge and worrying about him to
boot. Snot would be worrying anyway.

He was so impressed that he even asked Minnie if she had any other
chores. It was an ill-fated question, as it soon became apparent
that Minnie had very many chores that could be assigned to him. He
ended up minding simmering pots, beating butter from cream, and
washing dishes among other tasks.

Sometime after his breakfast, Melanie came in and told him that she
would be applying the masking villend, ironically none of it in his
face. It was a welcome change to be told before someone sprayed
something on him, and he found himself looking forward to the
next one. He did not afterall, cherish the idea of facing Master
Nuth again.

Several people he had not yet met came to the kitchen throughout
the morning. Most were malkemists of different stripes, either
passing through before or after meeting with the master. He also
met Alfred, the only servant he had not yet to met. He was a tall
bald man with whispy strands of ginger hair poking out from the
sides of his head. After he left, Jack asked Emily about him, and
he learned that he cared for the horses in the stable, as well as
the carriage and tack. This meant that he was often out gathering
feed or exercising the horses. Emily did not say so directly, but
Jack got the impression that he also ran errands for the master.

After lunch—a meal that Jack until that very moment had not know
existed—Emily pulled him out of the kitchen to help her with
folding laundry and making beds. Initially Jack was excited to
learn that the house employed the city washers to wash the laundry,
but when the laundry delivery came, the washer woman was unknown to
him.

He had never made beds before, so of course he made a complete hash
of it. Emily often had to redo his side of the affair. She did not
complain though, which made Jack more determined each time to do a
better job.

Jack did all of these chores in his pyjamas. His former clothes had
disappeared without a trace, which upset him somewhat, since his
coat was his most dearly cherished possession. It was old, it was
worn, but at one stage it had been a very sharp coat. Jack loved it
for the $glamour it had once bestowed on its owner. Though that
owner had never been Jack.

Like a bad penny Jack was passed from house servant to house
servant, and in the afternoon Alfred took over as his nanny. One
thing that Alfred taught Jack almost straight away, since he had
been too embarrassed to ask either Minnie or Emily, was how to use
the toilet. Jack had already looked inside the tiny house at the
end of the courtyard, but the little white throne inside made
absolutely no sense to him.

Alfred laughed heartily to hear Jack's confusion.

"You want to know how to use the toilet?" asked Alfred, his eyes
crinkled with good-natured mirth.

Jack shrugged his shoulders and gave a lop-sided nod to indicate
that that was of course what he wanted.

"Well, let's go to the outhouse, and I'll show you what's what,"
said Alfred with a smile.

"I what? Where?" Jack asked incredulously after the explanation.

"You lift the lid and poo in there!" Alfred indicated emphatically.

"In that? It's too pretty to shit in," Jack complained.

"Yeah, it's a pretty place for it. But that's what it's for. After
that you can wash yourself with the water in the basin here. Don't
go squatting on the seat like a monkey, Minnie will find you out
for sure, and I can't imagine she would be any gentler with you
than the last person who tried to pull that. Let me save you that
lecture, cause she'll just say 'your feet belong on the ground, not
on the seat!'. You know I'm giving you the short and sweet
version."

"What is this for?" Jack asked, pointing to some soap suspended
from a rope.

"To wash your hands afterwards of course. Don't let Minnie catch
you skipping that step, she's a sharp woman, and she'll know.
Let's get back to the stables, I'm sure you can figure this out for
yourself."

There were three horses in the stable. Each, Jack was assured by
Alfred, was a credit to the breed, and Jack had to admit that they
were very beautiful and magestic animals.

He had ridden one just like them the night before, but had not
really had the chance to appreciate one face to face. Only rich
people rode, and Jack had lost count of the number of times he had
been shooed or cursed at to make way for a passing horse, or to
simply get away from one.

Feeding them hay as they hung their heads over the highest plank of
their enclosure was $mesmerising for Jack. Alfred had to stop him
from overfeeding them in the end.

"That's enough of the sweet hay lad. Too much of that everyday and
they would eventually grow sick and feeble. They have ruffage there
to satisfy them."

Alfred moved into a stall with a large chestnut brown horse with a
splash of white on its forehead, and began rubbing her down with
his bare hands.

"Pass me the dandy brush lad," called Alfred, "the one with the
boar bristles."

Jack quickly picked up a brush and was about to pass it when he
$realised that the bristles were rice stalks, but before he could
fix his mistake, Alfred called out again.

"Not that one, the soft one."

Jack rushed to correct the blunder, practically launching himself
up the rails of the stall to pass the correct brush. The horse, not
expecting the sudden movement, shied backwards with its haunches
falling. Alfred seemed to take the violent reaction of the large
creature in his stride, keeping a firm and calming hand on the
horse's shoulder as it recovered, shushing and cooing throughout.

"Gently Jack, they aren't dogs," he admonished when the chestnut
had settled.

Alfred made quick work of the rub down, explaining that the horses
had not been ridden today, so there was little to be done. He
showed Jack how to pick up the front hooves by running his hand
down the back of her leg. He then did something similar for the
rear hooves. He lifted each hoof twice. Once to remove any dirt,
mud, or stones from the hoof with a pick while checking that the
shoe was secure, and once again to give the outer hoof a quick buff
and shine. Jack watched it all intently.

The clack of hooves in the alley drew Alfred to the stable door. He
sighted through a hole in the wall for a moment, and then quickly
swung the stable door open. Moments later two malkemists, ducking
under the lintel, rode into the stable and dismounted. One pointed
hat hit the lintel, deformed briefly, and then sprang back to its
original shape.

Both riders dismounted and strode purposefully from the stable in
the direction of the kitchen with serious expressions, wasting no
time with talk, except to tell Alfred that they would be leaving
again within the hour.

Alfred closed the stable door, then led the two horses to a trough
of water. They drank intermittently between snorts and heavy
breathing, obviously struggling to catch their breathes after what
must have been a strenuous ride. Meanwhile, Alfred removed their
saddles and gave them a quick rub down before lifting and
inspecting each hoof. Jack was very impressed by how thoroughly he
cared for the horses.

"We can't let them drink too much at once. Come, help me walk
them."

Alfred offered the reins of one horse to Jack and led his own to
the barn door.

"Stay close to her shoulder, keep two firm hands on the reins, and
don't take any nonsense."

They walked both horses up and down the alley several times before
returning them to the stables to drink again and lick at a salt
brick. Jack was surprised at how quickly they seemed to recover.
Once Alfred was happy that the horses had drunk as much as they
wanted he backed them into a stall each and offered them hay.

"I think we're done here boy. Go and ask Minnie if she has
something for you to do."

Jack presented himself to Minnie, who prompty set him to peeling
potatoes after seeing to it that he washed his hands carefully.
Minnie herself was busy cooking, which meant that the kitchen was
almost silent.

While he peeled, Jack puzzled at what business brought other
malkemists to visit Master Amoth, and whether it had anything to do
with him. It must be important and urgent for them to run the
horses until their flanks heaved. Had there been a confrontation
between Master Amoth's malkemists and the malkemists of Master
Nuth? Would there be fighting?

Jack could not believe that such a thing could occur because of
him, so there must be a deeper reason for the conflict between the
two masters. As far as Jack knew, there were only two masters in
Corsisan. Surely it was big enough for the both of them.

Minnie growled as she walked by, "You're cutting off more potato
than skin." She pinched his ear lightly.

Jack tried to concentrate, but just then the two malkemists
returned. The shortest of the two greeted Minnie as they passed
through.

"Ho Minnie, any treats for a poor scout?"

"I couldn't bare to let you go without one you handsome man,"
replied Minnie practically simpering. A package miraculously
appeared in her hands and she pressed it on the man with unseemly
forwardness. Marken grinned wide with pleasure, his torso leaning
$towards Minnie, but his feet following his fellow without so much as
a misstep.

"You're a gem of a woman, Minnie. It takes all my will not to
ravage you. If only I were free to follow my heart," he winked and
was gone.

Jack watched with wide-eyed fascination as Minnie flounced back
around her kitchen bench with a look of deep pleasure on her face.
She was the happiest that Jack had seen her. She completely ignored
the fact that Jack was still butchering the potatoes mercilessly
and ruffled his hair as she swept by. She resumed processing
defatted milk into kefir with a lingering smile.

That Marken fellow was some kind of genius.

Jack cut the potatoes into the chunks that had been requested and
transferred them to a pot on the stove just as Emily came in. The
mood became even rosier, if it were possible, as Emily recounted
her day. She had been in the same house the day through, but to
hear her tell it, it had been quite an exciting day. She poked fun
at Jack's blanket folding and prompted Minnie for other examples of
his ineptness, which the other woman was more than willing to give
in the moments she turned from her cooking.

Jack mashed the potato and Minnie seasoned it with some herbs,
butter, clotted cream, pepper, and salt. It was heavenly. Jack felt
a stab of guilt that his family was not enjoying the same back
home. The roast that Minnie had set to cook came out of the oven,
and she set Jack to stirring a gravy she mixed from the leftover
pan juices. In the meantime she plated several meals, one for each
of the malkemists staying in the house, and waited on "Jack's
gravy" as she called it. She had a clever way of passing on the
ownership of tasks that made the person doing them feel like they
had some kind of special stake. It was a dirty trick.

The three of them ran full trays over to the dining room across the
foyer and Minnie rang a bell. There were five places set for
dinner. Two for Master Amoth and Melanie, and the others for three
malkemists that Jack had only glimpsed in passing.

Back in the kitchen Alfred had presented himself, and they set
about plating their own meals. Jack was very careful to take his
own food, and he did it by serving the others. He was deeply
suspicious of how thoroughly and deeply he had slept the night
before, and did not want to eat anything that everyone else was not
also eating.

A bell rang and Minnie rushed out to check on the dining
malkemists. The rest of them dug into their food, Jack taking care
to eat much more slowly than was enjoyable or even comfortable,
even though Minnie was out of the room.

When Minnie returned she went to the counter opposite and began
pouring a glass of kefir for each of them.

"... nothing better for digestion than kefir. I wouldn't choose to
live without it myself," Minnie warbled.

Jack grew suspicious when the task took her slightly longer than it
should have. Unfortunately, her bulk hid what she was doing with
her hands. The spice rack was directly in front of her, so she
might have been doing almost anything.

Nevertheless, Jack did not take his eyes off her back. He was
rewarded moments later when under her elbow he saw her replace a
tiny blue bottle on the spice rack.

She was drugging him.

He was almost completely certain, but there would be no way to find
out except by falling for it. He struggled with himself briefly,
because he knew it meant that he would not be able to go out
tonight to see his family. <i>Patience</i>, he schooled himself,
<i>tomorrow would be just as good.</i>

Jack shoved a large hunk of meat into his mouth in petty vengeance.

Alfred took up where Emily had left off telling them of her day,
and they were treated to the comings and goings in the stable that
they may have missed. Jack finished his food and began on his milk
kefir as Alfred explained that he would need tallow to grease the
stable door hinges tomorrow, as they were beginning to creak.

Apparently Marken's companion had complemented Alfred on his care
of the horses and pressed a silver piece on him. It was evident
that Alfred was much more delighted by the compliment than the
coin.

"The lad is falling asleep," Alfred commented, "I don't think I
worked him that hard. It looks like he'll miss dessert, the poor
little guy." The last was spoken hopefully, but Minnie did what she
does best. Quashed his hopes.

"There'll be no dessert tonight, so he won't be missing anything,"
she said firmly, eyebrows drawn down in the $centre.

Alfred sighed heavily.

"Wash your mouth out Jack," Emily coaxed as she continued to eat.

Jack obediently picked his teeth clean and gargled with the salty
water by the wash basin. He returned to his seat and tried to fight
off the waves of sleepiness he was feeling.

He laid his head on his folded arms for a moment, to gather his
will, and...

***

Jack woke to the chirping of early springtime birds outside the
slats of his window. He could not remember dreaming, but he did
have a plan. He had also woken up in bed, rather than on the floor,
which was an improvement.

Disentangling himself from his blanket he noticed that his $pyjamas
were different. Still $pyjamas, but made from a thicker and
sturdier material. They were also brown, which he rather liked. The
blue $pyjamas had had no pockets, but this pair had a small pocket
over the left breast.

He was excited to start his day, so he went directly to the
kitchen, where he found Minnie was washing the dishes left over
from a breakfast that he had slept through.

"Good morning, Miss Minnie," Jack greeted as he went to the
half full reservoir.

"Morning," said Minnie without taking her attention from what she
was doing.

Jack immediately took his pail and began hauling water, with one
detour to the toilet. It took him a few less trips than the morning
before. Minnie had a simple breakfast of cheese, bread, and pickles
on the table for him by the time he had finished. Jack spared a
single glance for the little blue bottle in the spice rack. With
his mind suitably occupied, he managed to eat with rare decorum.

At some time today he wanted to be alone in the kitchen with that
bottle, but making that a possibility without revealing the desire
seemed impossible. He did not want to rely on blind luck. He
caught his gaze sneaking $towards the spice rack and he stopped
himself just in time. He reasoned that Minnie must leave the
kitchen to go to the market, but for all he knew she did so in the
small hours of the morning.

He also thought that she needed to go to the toilet like anyone
else, but a trickle of memory from her endless narrative the day
before reminded him that she took great pride in her regularity,
and that meant that she had gone long before he woke.

Undiscouraged, he finished his breakfast and washed his plate,
Minnie's silence a compliment in itself. Minnie set him to stirring
a great pot of milk and a plan began to form as he kept an eye on
the unexciting liquid.

Lunchtime. Minnie would almost certainly deliver the master's lunch
upstairs, and Jack would remain in the kitchen when she did. A few
minutes alone and the little blue bottle would lose its power to
send him to sleep.

Jack worked as dilligently and unobstrusively as he could, trying
to anticipate Minnie's needs before she had to mention them, and
to not be under foot when she needed him out of the way. The last
thing he wanted was to be sent away before lunchtime. Minnie had
not spoken two words to him for quite a while, which assured him
that his plan was on track.

Lunchtime was drawing near and Jack could almost feel the elation
of victory in his grasp. It was a good plan, and importantly, very
simple.

Emily ruined everything.

"Jack, I need your help, let's go," she called from the door. Jack
stood paralysed for a moment, his brain racing for a way to keep
him in the kitchen.

"He's been an angel this morning, I almost feel like holding on to
him," said Minnie, heartening Jack for a moment before continuing,
"but you can take him if you need him."

Jack followed Emily out in despondency, his one shot at getting rid
of the sleeping draught was gone. He cheered himself up with the
thought that he would have another opportunity tomorrow, but it
still meant that Mardy, Stine, Snot, and Hat would go another day
not knowing what had become of him. Emily had him help her fold
sheets recently delivered by the laundry ladies. The smell of the
sun, soap, and fresh air still clung to them, reminding him of
Mardy.

Emily was so cheerful that Jack was similarly disposed by the time
they went back to the kitchen for their own lunch. Both Minnie and
Alfred were already eating, and Alfred was talking of fetching
fresh feed for the horses in the afternoon. Jack washed his hands
and sat down to a delicious lunch. Enjoying regular meals was
novelty enough to eclipse his disappointment.

"I'd take you with me Jack, but you don't have proper clothes yet,"
explained Alfred.

"He'll have clothes soon," said Emily smiling, "they are being
tailored for his young sirness."

Jack's ears perked up at that, but Minnie clucked disapprovingly,
ending any further disclosure.

Alfred was the first to finish eating, followed by Minnie. She
stacked their plates by the washing trough and he went to run
his errands. Then Minnie left in the direction of the foyer.
Leaving Emily and Jack alone.

Jack carried his own plate to the trough and began washing.

"Come find me when you've finished the dishes Jack," said Emily as
she left in the same direction as Minnie.

Jack found himself alone in the kitchen.

He wasted no time before scrambling for the small blue bottle. He
uncapped it and tried to pour the contents out in the drain, but
the mouth was so small that the contents only came out in a squirt
when he knocked the base. He jogged it back and forward desperately
trying to get it all out, his heart beating furiously under the
threat of someone walking in on him at any moment.

He heard conversation from the foyer and almost lost his grip on
the bottle in his haste to empty it. He was sure that he not going
to make it, the draught just would not come out. He would be
discovered for sure.

Still, no one came through the door, and slowly the bottle emptied.
Unfortunately, that was only half the job, he still had to fill it
again for Minnie to use it without suspicion during his evening
meal.

The bottle was finally empty and he plunged it into the reservoir
to refill it, but he encountered the exact same problem again. The
mouth was too small to allow much water back into the bottle at a
time. He shook the bottle back and forth in the water in a frenzy,
rushing to fill it.

The foyer door opened.

Jack picked up the drinking ladle and brought it to his lips, the
blue bottle hidden in his left fist. Minnie entered, cast him a
curious glance and then went to the stove.

Jack had no time to check how much water he had managed to put into
the bottle. Desperate and uncaring, he twisted the cap back on and
rolled the wet bottle in the absorbant material of his $pyjama
pants.

Minnie was adjusting the stove to cook.

Jack spun the die. He walked $towards the dishes, hoping that
Minnie did not turn too soon. As he passed the spice rack he
reached out with the blue bottle in hand, and... pulled it back
sharply as Minnie turned around. His heart and breath motionless in
his chest.

Minnie looked at him but said nothing, and he continued to the dish
trough as nonchalantly as he could manage, certain that Minnie had
grown suspicious.

The blue bottle was tingling in his hand. He had to get rid of it
somehow, but he could not do it directly under Minnie's nose. He
considered putting it in the bottom of the trough while he washed
the dishes, but it seemed much too risky. His only chance was to
slip it into his $pyjama shirt pocket, but with his back to Minnie,
he had no idea whether her eyes were on him or not.

He only had a moment to consider all of this, as any delay would be
suspicious. He took the risk. Not knowing whether Minnie was
watching him or not, he transferred the bottle to his right hand,
dropped it into the shirt pocket over his heart, and began washing
the dishes.

Minnie was quiet. In fact, the only sound he could hear at all was
the soft, soft squeal of his soapy cotton dishcloth on the glazed
plate in his hand. She should have been doing something; taking a
pot or utensil, fetching ingredients, breathing. Nothing.

The silence stretched on.

Jack knew that he had been caught. All that was left was to turn
around and face it. He dropped the dishcloth in the trough and set
 himself to turn around.

A pot clanked as it was placed on the stove. Minnie's feet shifted
and her moccasins scraped against the stone floor.

Jack took up his dishcloth again and got back to washing the
dishes. Relieved to have avoided Minnie's ire. However, he quickly
$realised that he was washing himself into a corner. As soon as he
finished the dishes, he would have to leave the kitchen, and if he
could not replace the blue bottle by then, he might not have
another opportunity before Minnie $realised it was missing.

Finishing the dishes, he rinsed the suds down the drain, rinsed and
wrung the washcloth, and then hung it to dry on the edge of the
washing trough. He was about to head to the foyer when Minnie
brushed past him, turned left at the reservoir and then disappeared
into the pantry.

Jack had his chance. He fumbled with his pocket, knowing that he
only had a few moments to spare. The bottle had lain down sideways
in the pocket, and caught in the soft fabric as he tried to pull it
free. Pinching the bottom of the pocket with his other hand he
managed to pull the bottle out and deftly deposited it back in its
place on the rack.

He practically jogged from the room, his face split in a fierce
grin of triumph.

***

The rest of the day threatened to drag by like running molasses on
a cold day, and even Emily's busyness did not help to drive the
timeparts forward against their inclination. He and Emily carried
floor runners from upstairs out into the rear courtyard and used
iron rods to beat dust from the dense $fibres. It did wonders for
dispelling the nervous tension that had been building in him, but
did not rush him $towards dinner time any faster.

Together they returned upstairs and laid the largest runner down
the hallway. They were about to return to the courtyard for another
when Master Amoth stepped out of his study.

"Jack, could I have a word with you?" he beckoned. "My apologies
Emily, you'll have to do without him."

Jack felt a thrill of unease as old stories about what malkemists
could do rose into his mind. Did Master Amoth already know that he
had tipped the sleeping potion down the drain? How was it possible?

Emily curtsied without saying a word and went upon her way.

Master Amoth smiled as Jack passed by him into the study and closed
the door. He then went to the large grimense board and sat down.
Scooping up a letter from the table, he read it idly, as though he
had forgotten about Jack for the moment.

Jack tried to stand at ease, but it was difficult, given that he
did not know what was coming.

"Do you know what this is?" Master Amoth asked, fluttering the
paper in his hand slightly.

"No sirness," Jack replied, feeling trapped.

"It's a report. I read dozens of them a day. They tell me about the
world outside," explained Amoth, indicating with his other hand
that Jack should approach.

He passed the letter to Jack and instructed him to read it.

Jack knew that he was being played with. The letter surely held
information about his actions in the kitchen, somehow transferred
to the paper through a mechanism that only the malkemists
themselves understood. He beat down the surliness that threatened
to overcome him, and managed to reply civily.

"I cannot read sirness."

Master Amoth reached out his hand and took back the letter, his
face inscrutable.

"Do you know what sets malkemists apart from koyim Jack?"

Jack shrugged his shoulders.

"We can't do magic."

"Technically we don't do magic either, it just looks like magic.
The abilities the koyim think of when they think of malkemists are
linked with bloodlines and families, but that isn't really what
sets us apart. Would you like another guess?"

Jack wanted to say, their hats, but he was not feeling anywhere
near comfortable enough to be so flippant. He shook his head.

"This." He gestured to the bookshelves, "This separates us. The
ability to record our experiences from one generation to the next.
Our literacy is our defining characteristic. Our children learn the
power of the word almost from the cradle. We take pride in a
heritage of transmission that spans millenia. While the guenic
tribes were still living in huts we were passing on the accumulated
knowledge of a hundred generations.

"We take care to keep our written works out of the hands of the
koyim, and we discourage the koyim from learning letters at all,
though the rich still do with their cobbled together alphabets.  It
has, and I imagine always will be, a taboo among us to teach
letters to outsiders. Some of our libraries go even further and
have laws and harsh penalties against it."

Master Amoth had been staring into Jack's eyes, but when he stopped
talking, it became uncomfortable. Finally, he asked a question.

"Would you like to learn Jack?"

Jack nodded.

***

Jack sat at the kitchen bench and pulled the small folded slip of
paper out of his $pyjama pocket. Ten words were neatly written on
the thick paper, written from memory by Master Amoth himself. They
were the ten most commonly written words, and Master Amoth had
recited them for Jack and made him remember their sounds before
leaving his study.

Jack ran through them now, reciting them under his breath. Master
Amoth had forbidden him to speak the words out loud for others to
hear. Minnie caught sight of the paper with a start before a
considering look entered her eyes.

"Master Amoth has taken a shine to you boy. I've never seen
anything like it. You had best not ruin it with any foolishness.
For whatever crazy reason, he has taken into his master's head to
place great expectation on you. I think he's crazy, but while he's
coming to his senses, you take care to not let him down," Minnie
said, her words hard, but something in her eyes that may have been
easily mistaken for care on someone else's face.

Jack nodded carefully.

Both Emily and Alfred pretended as though they had not seen the
paper at all.

Jack's food beckoned and he began to eat. Minnie meanwhile, with
her back turned, was preparing a fermented drink she had made from
toasted rye bread, rock sugar, and the yeasty dregs of a previous
ferment. She promised Jack that he would like it even more than
milk kefir. Jack was skeptical, but open to the experience,
especially since he anticipated that it would not send him directly
to sleep this evening.

He did not see Minnie take or replace the small blue bottle, but he
was sure that she had used it yet again.

He drank down his sweet and yeasty drink without a hint of unease.
As Minnie had promised he really did like it more than the milk
kefir. He would have smiled but for the fact that he was wondering
how best to fake falling asleep. How long had it taken last night?
Not long, only a few score heartbeats.

Judging the time roughly he began to blink his eyes, as though
trying to clear them. Then a jaw cracking yawn. He could see that
Minnie wanted to scold him for not covering his mouth, but she
restrained herself. He did it again.

Instead she told him to wash his hands and face and rinse out his
mouth. He did as instructed and returned to the table to lay his
head in his arms with his eyes closed. The theatrics were over.

"He's a sweet boy. It seems wrong to drug him every night, but I
suppose the master knows what he's doing," said Emily.

"Of course he does," said Minnie.

"Alfred, could you help me carry him to his room again? He's
heavier than he looks," Emily requested.

"My pleasure Miss Emily."

The same strong gentle hands that tended to the horses all day
scooped Jack from his seat. Jack was treated to one of the great
pleasures of life. Being carried. At least on this night he was
aware of it.

Alfred's steady movements had him in his bed in no time, leaving
Jack with the fleeting impression of loss. As Emily and Alfred
retreated from the room, so did their lamplight. Within moments
Jack was immersed in darkness.

But he was awake.

As much as he wanted to launch himself out of bed and be away, he
tempered his eagerness. The house would be a hive of activity for a
good time yet, so he set himself to wait out the tardy sleepers of
the house.

***

Jack woke to a puff of cold mist in his face, and barely had the
presence of mind to keep his eyes closed and a grimace of annoyance
off his face. Instead, he groaned a little, turned into his pillow,
and lay still.

Melanie, at least Jack assumed that it was Melanie, stood over him
for a few heartbeats; apparently satisfying herself that he was
really sleeping.

Jack listened carefully as she left the room.

<i>Did she close the door?</i> Jack wondered in paranoia. He had
not heard the door move. He imagined her in his mind's eye watching
from the open doorway, a knowing smirk on her face.

Jack waited. There was no sound.

He almost opened his eyes, but then thought better of it when he
imagined opening his eyes to the sight of her face only inches from
his own. He waited again.

Finally, he hit upon a clever strategy. He rolled as though sleepily
shifting in bed and flung an arm out into the space where he had
imagined Melanie's face. The air was empty.

Emboldened, he cracked his eyelids a fraction and peered between
his lashes. Nobody stood beside his bed. Then, lolling his head in
the sleepiest manner he could manage, he pointed his shrouded eyes
at the door.

The door was closed.

Irritated, Jack opened his eyes and swung out of bed. He had wasted
precious time hiding from a phantom. His slat filled window looked
out on Minnie's courtyard garden, but it was locked tight against
intruders. Padding to the door, he applied slow gentle pressure to
the lever and drew the door inward.  Outside, the hall was empty,
as was the foyer. He closed his door behind himself and moved
quietly over the stone floor to the kitchen. He noticed a light
fanning out from beneath the door of the room next to his, but had
no idea who was inside. The kitchen was dark, so he pushed through
that door without trepidation and moved out to the courtyard. He
would have preferred to leave via the stable, but he was sure that
Alfred slept there at night, so he avoided it.

Under the light of the moon, Jack picked out the path to the roof
he had planned during the day. He climbed to the steepled roof of
the well and was sizing up the jump to the lintel above the door
when he realised that he could make the courtyard wall from where
he was. He made the leap to the courtyard wall instead. Within
moments he was outside, once more on the streets.

Before he moved off, some growing impulse in him demanded that he
fold up the pant and shirt sleeves of his $pyjamas. It would not do
to have Emily complain about how dirty they were. That is what he
told himself at any rate.

The street felt comfortable. He felt at home. It was enough to make
him $realise that he had been feeling uncomfortable in the house,
despite the luxury and the food.

He began to run. The smells and sounds of the town guiding him
home. His feet beat a steady tattoo on the stone streets and he
moved swiftly. He kept away from the streets that the city guard
patrolled regularly, and it did not take him long to be among the
mud palaces with their rain eroded streets and occasional snarling
curs.

This was where he had to be more careful. The city guard
$advertised their presence, that was their job. The watchers among
the mud palaces never $advertised a thing, they might find
themselves dead if they did. Jack knew where many of them lurked
through long familiarity, but even he could not pretend to know
them all.  Instead of trying, he headed for the rooftops as soon as
he knew there was a direct route across them to his home. These
rooves were much less trustworthy than the tiled world of the upper
town, but his light frame and knowledge held him in good stead.

By the time he arrived at his building, he had disturbed birds,
rats, and mice nestled in the thatch by the score. He slid from the
thickly layered thatch to a second story landing, thankful that
there had been no rain to make the thatch slimy and treacherous. He
slipped within the building and moved quickly to the room he shared
with his family, overjoyed to finally be home.

He tested the door, ready to knock for Stine or Mardy to unlatch it
from the inside, only to discover that it was not locked. Perhaps
they had left it open for him, fearful that he might not be able to
rouse them from sleep if he returned. It did not seem right, but he
grasped at it. He let himself in.

He noticed immediately that the smell was wrong. When people sleep
in close quarters with little air, a distinct scent develops. He
was used to being assaulted by it whenever he came home in the
small hours of the morning.

The smell simply was not there. He smelled musk and mould, but not
his family. Something was wrong. Jack felt around on the floor for
a sleeping form, but he already knew that he would find no one. The
floor was bare. No blankets, no clothes, no pots, no warm bodies.
Empty.

Jack grew scared. They would not have moved. Something must have
happened to them and he needed to find out what.

Unwilling but determined, he knocked on the next door. Their
immediate $neighbour was an unpleasant old man who worked on the
river docks. He was grouchy, but not dangerous.

Jack knocked a second time as the door swung inward just enough for
the occupant to peer out.

"Who is it?" came the annoyed whisper.

"Jack."

"What do you want?" this whispered question was laced with disgust.

"Where did Mardy and Stine go?" Jack asked in a whisper, ignoring
the tone.

"Didn't see, but..." he mentioned the wife of a heavy drinking
$neighbour, and certainly not someone he wanted to wake in the
middle of the night, "... said they were taken by some men
yesterday."

Jack was shocked. <i>Who would care enough about them to cause any
trouble?</i>

Before Jack could ask for details, the old man was closing his door
tight with a muffled and uncharitable suggestion $towards what Jack
should do with the rest of his evening.

Jack sat back on his haunches in shock. Not shock at the inventive
cussing that had just sprung from Old Makky's mouth. That he had
expected. He was $paralysed by the questions coming too quickly to
his mind for him to even be aware of them.

No one would have come for his family with anything but harm in
mind. They were not valuable enough for anyone to care. He was
certain of that much.

He was no malkemist. There was no way for him to track the people
who had done this. For all he knew, it might even have been one of
the two rival malkemist groups in town, or another he was not yet
aware of. Although he would have expected malkemists in this area
of town to have caused a great flurry, like a fox suddenly set
among the hens. Old Makky would probably not be here himself if he
thought that malkemists had paid a visit. The superstitions and old
wives tales of the mud palaces could rival the best that the shanty
town, or even visiting rural workers, had to offer.

Jack crept out of the place that was no longer home, feeling
uprooted. He was scared now. Deeply scared in a way that the
threats to his own body and life had not had a hope of touching.

He returned to the malkemist house via its roof. Lying flat, head
first down the steep roof, he reached over and under the edge of
the tiles to grasp the hidden eave frame and lowered himself in a
slow, controlled roll; taking particular care not to pop the
buttons on the front of his $pyjamas, something he had never had to
worry about in the past.  Dropping from the eaves with his bum
turned out from the wall, he landed on the generous lintel above
the courtyard door, then scrambled down from there to the ground.

Dusting himself off quietly, he then washed his feet and hands
at the well, all the while telling himself that being clean was
necessary to avoid suspicion.

By the time he made his way back to his wide and comfortable bed,
he was bone weary with grief and helplessness.

***

Jack woke earlier than usual and had to confine himself to his bed.
He wanted to be out. He wanted to do begin his chores. The wait was
torturous.

He had opened his eyes in untroubled comfort, but as everything
from the night before came back to him, a heavy weight settled on
his heart. He was sick with it by the time he judged the sun to be
high enough for him to get out of bed.

He wandered into the kitchen.

"Get those $pyjamas off and give yourself a bath," greeted Minnie.

Jack did as he was told, striping down to the skin. He drew a
pail of water from the reservoir and started washing the important
places. There were really only a bare few of them according to Jack.

Halfway through his ablutions, Minnie gave a growl and came
charging across the room like a wounded bull. Jack cringed before
her, expecting to be struck, but she just grabbed him by the hair
and upended half of the contents of the pail over his head.

"... if you can't be trusted to do it yourself, I'll do it for you!
But if I do it, you won't enjoy it. Not one bit! Start at the top
and..."

She did not use the brush this time, which was a small mercy, but
she did use the grit-filled soap. Jack suspected that that was not
an accident. Minnie said what she meant, and meant what she
said. However, from soap, to woolen flannel, to rinse, the process
was thankfully short.

Jack was allowed to scrape himself dry with a proffered strigil,
for which he was terribly, and shamefully, grateful.

Once he was dry, and Minnie had powdered him, he slipped into his
baby-blue $pyjamas. He noticed that the hems had been properly
sewn. Thinking of Emily taking the time to improve his clothes,
even if they were his baby-blue $pyjamas, touched him. That same
feeling made him remember his family, and the fear was back in a
moment.

Minnie must have noticed the look on his face.

"You think that reservoir is going to fill itself. It ain't. Off
you go. You know where your pail is."

Jack set to work.

***

Soldier Halme breezed into the kitchen near midday, and Jack
noticed for the first time that he dressed immaculately. Even after
what must have been close to an hour in the sewer he had emerged
looking ready for the ball. Jack did not know whether he should be
impressed or appalled. He was not wearing his malkemist hat at the
moment, but it hardly mattered now that Jack knew what he was.

"Good morning to you Mistress Minnie," said Halme, offering a
respectful bow, "I brought you a treat from the market."

He placed a rough hessian bag on the bench and drew out a strange
purplish fruit.

"Passionfruit!" exclaimed Minnie, "Thank you soldier. This is a
treat."

Jack noticed that although she was pleased, she did not react with
any of the warmth that she had shown Marken.

"Well Jack, have you had your dose of masking villend this
morning?" asked Halme, drawing back his coat in a show of
eagerness.

Jack nodded twice, his face serious.

"Oh? That is disappointing," he complained lightly as he let his
coat fall back into place. His brief smile touching his eyes.

"Minnie would you mind if I took your charge for a short while?
Master Amoth has requested a game, and we both thought young Jack
might be enriched to watch on."

"Be my guest. Just don't wear him out, he still has quite a few
chores to do this afternoon."

Halme thanked her and beckoned Jack to the foyer.

On the way up the stairs Jack blurted, "She doesn't like you."

"What a nasty thing to say," replied Halme easily, completely
disarming Jack. "Do you think she'll warm up to me?" he asked in a
tone that Jack could not decide was mockery or earnestness.

"No."

Halme laughed.

Knock, knock.

"Come in," called Master Amoth.

Once inside the study, Jack noticed that Master Amoth looked quite
tired. The master dry washed his face with his hands as though
bringing himself out of a stupor, but then belied the impression by
practically bounding around the desk to greet Halme.

"I thought I'd bring the boy up to watch our game," Halme said as
he reached Master Amoth and clasped his forearm, "if you don't mind
being humiliated in front of company." It was not a question.

Master Amoth laughed with genuine pleasure at Halme's bravado.

"Come, come. Let's play."

Both men sat at the grimense board facing each other across the
checkered squares. The board itself was composed of sixteen by
sixteen alternating black and white squares. The pieces, arranged
facing each other, filled the first two rows and two squares in the
third row. There were ten distinct types of pieces on the board,
but each player had thirty-four pieces at the start of the game.

"Draw yourself up a stool Jack, you'll want to catch this," invited
Master Amoth.

If it were really their intention to instruct Jack in the game,
they did a poor job as they opened quickly without regard for Jack's
confusion. Master Amoth moved first and then they took turns. Often
barely waiting for the other person to place a piece before they
picked up their own piece to play.

"Our old friend Nuth has been quite busy. It was quite risky to get
word to you."

Halme advanced a piece with a decisive click.

"Yes, it's a good thing we got wind of that before he pounced,"
said Master Amoth.

Halme nodded in agreement.

"They are safely away?" asked Halme.

"Very safe. We have people watching the young ones and throwing
them a few coins here and there. We might even be able to get the
girl higher post."

Master Amoth slid one of his pieces forward, covering one of his
extended pieces.

"And the older boy?"

"Discrete inquiries turned up that he is a dilligent and skilled
worker, he will look after himself. There was no cause to
interfere. Since the girl keeps them together, we thought it better
to assist her more directly than the others.

Halme responded with another decisive move that drew a frown from
Master Amoth. The pace of the game was slowing now, both men
considering their moves with much more care.

"What about our rodent problem?" asked Halme.

"No problem," answered Amoth. "It couldn't sleep and wondered from
the nest, but it was back by morning.

"Fascinating," replied Halme, though whether he was talking about
Master Amoth's answer, or the board, Jack could not tell.

Of course Jack knew what their conversation was about, but he
studiously avoided eye contact with either man. It jolted him to
$realise that Master Amoth knew that he had left the house. That he
knew Jack had left the house despite the master very carefully
warning him not to. Jack's eye's slid up Master Amoth's arm to his
jaw, but he could not bring himself to look into his eyes. Jack's
gaze slunk back to the board.

Then the rest of what they had been saying finally sank in. These
men were discussing the safety of his family. They had done things
to protect his family. It defied every experience and expectation
that he had ever had. That grown men would move a finger beyond
their own interests was incomprehensible. Strong men ruled weaker
men, and weaker men ruled over women and children.

Jack was crying. He had not meant to cry. He never cried. Tears
were welling in his eyes nonetheless. There was no sobs, no twisted
features, but there was nothing he could do to control the flow of
tears.

He was mortified. He tried to stop them. He lowered his head so
that the men would not see and willed the tears back to wherever
they had sprung from. But it was a useless effort because another
wave of relief was washing over him.

A single tear fell from his left eye and rolled down his impassive
face. His eye felt drier for it and he was glad.

<i>Good,</i> he thought, <i>It's under control.</i>

Then a single tear fell from his right eye. It too felt drier. He
blinked both eyes quickly.

Master Amoth's hand entered his vision. It was upturned, and upon
it sat the cleanest and whitest handkerchief that Jack had ever
seen. He took it slowly, still not daring to look him in the eye.

Jack braced himself for a taunt from Soldier Halme as he dabbed
first one eye and then the other, but all that came was a loud
click as Master Amoth made a confident move.

Jack returned the handkerchief to Master Amoth, noting two tiny
blue birds embroidered into one corner.

He had to get this over with, so he lifted his head and practically
glared at Soldier Halme. <i>Go ahead,</i> he challenged.

But Halme just looked back. There was no twinkle in his eyes, no
smile on his lips, or worse yet, and what Jack had been expecting,
a smirk. He merely looked at Jack a moment, then transferred his
attention back to the grimense board, one hand idly scratching at
his goatee.

And suddenly his perception of Soldier Halme shifted.

Jack finally looked at Master Amoth.

Unlike Halme, Jack saw sterness there, and some anger.

"Have you finished your words?" he asked, his tone hard.

Jack stared at him in confusion for a moment, trying to wring the
meaning he had been expecting from those simple words. <i>How dare
you do the thing I expressly forbade!</i> But it was not there.

Eventually Jack managed a nod.

"Can you handle twenty more words?"

"Yes."

"Varlay, give me your paper."

Jack handed it over and the master neatly scribed another twenty
words between moves. He spoke the words out loud and made Jack
repeat them until he had the twenty committed to memory.

"Make sure you review each word out of sequence. Backwards or at
random. If you don't, you'll be wasting your time."

"Yes, sirness."

Halme played a move that injured one of the master's pieces. A
strong piece suddenly became a weakness and threatened to drag the
pieces around it into a depressed state. Both men were calculating
the new movement abilities of the remaining pieces. Since
attempting to move a piece further than it legally could resulted
in injury, it behooved the opponent to keep a very close eye on
exactly what the other could and could not do.

Jack struggled to understand what was going on, since the rules had
not been fully explained to him. Maybe one of the books on the wall
could tell him. With that thought in mind, he ran through his first
ten words, $recognising them easily in any order, before he began
on the new twenty.

Master Amoth had told him that a vocabulary of only two hundred
words would be enough for him to begin reading by himself. It
seemed like a very small number of words to be able to read a whole
language, but Master Amoth insisted that all malkemist children
learned this way. Although, he admitted, at a much younger age than
Jack.

Almost an hour later the two men were still battling furiously.

"Has there been any trouble over at the Red Library?" asked Master
Amoth, considering his next move.

"None that I didn't stir up," replied Halme sheepishly.

The master looked up sharply.

"No, no, not recently, this was from long before." said Halme
quickly, his hands patting the air in front of him in placation, "A
malkemist from Lobiah, his name was Nywrist. The idiot challenged
me to a duel right there in the library."

"By the Prime Imaginer! Why?" asked Amoth incredulously.

"He had some cause," said Halme, "at least I can imagine how he
might see things poorly, as they were."

Jack watched Halme carefully. He was getting to know the man's
mannerisms, and they were presently screaming understatement.

"I swapped around some of his store creatively, and since he had no
talent for sensing, he didn't notice. His own fault really, he
ought to have paid more attention in class. Long story short, he
ended up losing all of his hair. And I mean all of it."

"For what purpose?" asked Amoth, intent.

Halme grimaced and pursed his lips in mild embarrassment, "I don't
recall there was a purpose. Well, besides him being a..." he
glanced at Jack, "pain."

Master Amoth snorted in disbelief.

"So, what happened at the library?"

Halme shrugged, "He lost. Nasty business a man dying for his pride.
Best to swallow it and live."

"I don't suppose he would have challenged you to a duel if he
expected to lose."

"Nobody expects to lose a duel to a half-breed," replied Halme
glibly.

Master Amoth nodded in agreement, "The old ways are strong in some
families. Underestimating a half-breed has been the end of quite a
number of full-bloods.

"It baffles me that you have accumulated so many casual enemies."

"It baffles me too," said Halme in a wry tone that indicated
anything but, "though some are less casual than others."

Master Amoth seemed to suddenly become aware of Jack, who was
sitting quietly in open and plain sight.

"Jack, you can run along if you want, I'm sure Minnie is missing
your services by now. I have decided that I do not want any
witnesses to my looming defeat afterall."

Jack returned his stool to the place where he had found it.

"Do knock on my door if you think you're ready for more words, or
ask Melanie, she used to teach at Huxlots," Master Amoth offered.

"You could ask me too," Halme said with a slightly mocking smile.

Jack offered his best bow, which was terrible, and left the room.

***

Jack did not see the little blue bottle at dinner, which relieved
him of the need to feign slumber after he ate. He watched everyone
very carefully until he $realised that none of them were taking
special notice of him at all. With a inward sigh, he relaxed.

To Jack's surprise, Minnie, Emily, and Alfred did not immediately
go their separate ways after the dishes were cleared and washed.
Instead, they sat down again at the kitchen bench and Alfred pulled
a small wooden box from his coat.

"Can you play cards boy?" Alfred asked.

Jack shook his head.

"We'll have to teach you then. Do you know your numbers?"

Jack shook his head again.

Alfred just nodded, taking Jack's ignorance in his stride.

"This is a two," he explained, pointing to the numeral two, "notice
that the card has two acorns. This is a three, with the three
hearts..."

"Argh, skip it Fred. Let's just play crazy eights and let him pick
it up as he goes," groused Minnie as she returned to the table with
a large bottle of her special brew.

"You're right I suppose Min, but I was hoping to get him up to
speed for a game of Contract..."

"Ooh, yes!" exclaimed Minnie, her eyes lighting up, "I wasn't
thinking. Do you think he'll grasp it?"

Alfred just smiled as he shuffled the cards, and Minnie poured out a
small glass of her brew for each of them, including Jack, although
his fell far shy of a full portion.

"My potion here has been known to set grown men on their ear, so you
take it easy," she explained to Jack.

Jack picked up the game of Crazy Eights quickly, since all it took
was to match the numeral on the face-up card or it's house; hearts,
bells, acorns, or leaves. For the first half dozen games Alfred
tallied his loses for him, explaining how the numbers added up,
while Jack struggled to make sense of it. Mardy had tried to
explain numbers to him once before, but she had not really known
how they worked herself, which meant that she had not been able to
tell Jack the use of them.

Then all of a sudden it clicked that tens were groups of ones and
he was off and running with his own figures. He was slow, but he
was doing it himself.

Minnie was cheered by his progress and gave him great
encouragement. It turned out that she was a passionate player of
the game Contract, and three people were not enough to play. In her
excitement she forgot herself, plying Jack with both praise and
hard liquor until Emily actually had to take his glass away, lest
he fall over drunk. Minnie laughed uproariously when she $realised
what she had been inadvertently doing.

The three of them became cheerier as more and more hands were
dealt.

"Has your suitor come calling this week Miss Emily?" asked Minnie,
throwing out a pair of fives.

"He did," replied Emily with a prim smile.

"Well?"

Emily shrugged. "He's shy. I'm hardly ever sure if he's calling on
me, or just enquiring about the weather. He did give me this
though." She pulled a string necklace from her blouse, with a small
wooden bird hanging from it.

Jack felt a sliver of jealousy.

"Now you be careful Emily, you never know what those far-off
country folk have up their sleeves, and what strange witching
they can call upon!" Minnie warned, heartening Jack no end.

"I'm sure it isn't enchanted Min. I thought it was quite sweet
of him."

Alfred reached out his hand. "May I?"

Emily slipped the necklace over her head and passed it to Alfred.

"It's very fine. He could be a scultor with this skill," commended
Alfred.

"Oh, I do like a scultors. Lovely hands," said Minnie with arch
innocence. She made a show of rearranging her cards, though it
was not her turn.

Alfred gave Minnie a look of amused reproof, but Emily only laughed
and took back her necklace.

Jack won the round and Alfred tipped over the losing count,
finishing the game. Emily crowed in triumph.

Minnie gave Alfred an enquiring look.

"Varley, let's try Contract," he responded. "The play itself is
easy Jack, but that part is really just a consequence of the
negotiations at the start." He fanned the deck out on the bench and
Minnie, Emily, and himself took a card each.

"Take one Jack," Alfred urged. "Then turn it up."

Jack turned over a malkemist, Emily a seven, Minnie a queen, and
Alfred a knight.

"Your malkemist and the queen are high, so you and Minnie will be
partners. I'll look at your hand for this first round to get you
going."

Alfred took the cards and reshuffled them, then dealt out thirteen
cards to each person.

"Lay out your cards Jack, we'll run through an open hand."

Jack did as he was told, which was easier than holding thirteen
cards in his hand anyway. Alfred sorted his cards from highest to
lowest, and then suggested the bid for Jack to signal to Minnie
that he had a good chance of winning seven or so tricks on in
hearts. Emily, Minnie, and Alfred followed with their bids, cards
hidden.

Jack won the bidding, and Emily played the first card before Minnie
opened her cards up on the table.

The first couple of rounds went went by in a befuddled blur for
Jack. All three adults were using terms and phrases he had never
heard before, and each bearing little seeming correspondence to its
actual meaning. However, before Minnie's brows actually touched he
began to get the hang of it.

Alfred schooled him in his numbers as the scores rose, expecting
Jack to keep both sides of the scoring in his head, and add the new
tallies as they were counted.

By the end of the night his head was aching.

***

The next morning Jack went straight to the reservoir to quench his
fierce thirst. Minnie greeted him with a broad grin and a pat on
the back that almost sent him to the floor.

"Jack my boy!" she boomed, "Let's get you into some clean clothes."
She was in frighteningly high spirits, and Jack was not at all sure
if he preferred it to her usual grumpiness.

He stripped off his clothes and endured a cold wipedown.

"You'll make a fine Contract player, my little nugget. If I'd only
known you had a natural gift for the game, I'd have had you playing
with us every night..." Minnie's voice faded $towards the end of
her sentence and she fell silent.

Before Jack could puzzle over what had come over her, malkemists
clumped their way into the kitchen from the direction of the
stable.

They looked like hard men, the kind that Jack would certainly stay
far away from if he ran into them in the shanty town, or anywhere
else for that matter. Both men had eyes that sized up the room in a
desultory fashion and then ignored it as soon as they were sure
there were no threats. How they managed to come to that conclusion
with Minnie beside him, Jack had no idea.

Jack shrank in on himself and kept his eyes down. He felt naked.

"Ho Soldiers, you'll be wanting to see Archivist Melanie, do take a
seat in the foyer, and I'll let her know you're waiting,"
encouraged Minnie with a nod at the foyer door, plainly wanting the
men conveyed through her kitchen as quickly as possible. The lead
man acknowledged her words with a dour nod as he opened the door to
the foyer and went through. The second man followed. A boy, a
little bigger than Jack, suddenly appeared from the corridor,
scurrying after the malkemists. He was dressed in nice clothes,
though they were travel stained. He dismissed Jack's naked and
cowering form as readily as the men and followed them into the
foyer. Minnie did not speak again until the door was firmly closed
behind them.

"I don't like strange faces in my kitchen," she muttered,
surprising Jack, who had come to expect only the bold and forceful
from the large lady. He felt an irrational desire to pat her arm.
The same arm that could no doubt launch him through a window with
ease.

"I think I know the boy though, he must be the Grand Imaginer's son.
Did you notice his left hand? He kept it hidden in his sleeve."

Jack had noticed that peculiarity.

"Here you go, quick step into your $pyjamas, and go fetch Melanie
to the foyer for us."

With his brown $pyjamas on he passed both malkemists and the boy
sitting in the foyer and went to Melanie's room. He knocked on the
door quietly and waited. Melanie answered within moments in her
robes and dress hat.

"Yes Jack?"

"Malkemists for you in the foyer Mistress Melanie," said Jack,
exhausting every scrap of breeding that he had ever managed
to beg, borrow, or steal. He certainly had not been born with any.

"Thank you Jack," she said, smiling at him. To his surprise, she
pulled the door closed behind her and went directly to the foyer.

Jack hung back as she greeted them there. It seemed that she knew
at least one of the soldiers and she conducted them upstairs almost
immediately.

He returned to the kitchen burning with curiosity, but before he
could work up the courage to ask Minnie any questions she had sent
him to haul water.

When he finished that task, Alfred snagged him to walk the horses
up and down the back alley. If Alfred had any curiosity about the
newcomers and their young charge, it was subsumed by his care for
their horses.

"Why is this horse smaller than the others Alfred?" Jack asked.

"Because it isn't a horse," he grunted.

"It looks like a horse," Jack replied in confusion.

"It's a mule. The offspring of a jack and a mare."

"A jack?" Jack asked.

Alfred laughed. "You know I've never thought about it, but I
suppose that is what you're named for." He chuckled to himself a
little longer before letting Jack in on the joke. "A Jack is a male
donkey lad. Don't feel bad, a donkey is a very clever animal. Much
smarter than a horse in fact; just no where near as majestic. They
probably chose a mule for the boy since he's crippled on the left
side. A mule has nearly the size, strength, and endurance of a
horse, but is more intelligent and better tempered, if a bit
stubborn. A perfect mount for a young one."

The mule was, despite Alfred's mistrust of its intelligence, a
well-trained and obedient animal. Unlike the horses, which all
towered above Jack, the mule was much closer to his size. It
quickly became his $favourite.

"You have these beautiful creatures before you," Alfred gestured to
the slick and powerful steeds in the stalls, "and you're fawning
over the illegitimate offspring of two creatures that would never
choose to breed in the wild." He sighed heavily in mock disgust.

Jack received that quietly.

"Do you have a father Jack?" Alfred asked perceptively.

"Everyone has a father," Jack replied.

"Do you know him?"

"I don't even know who my mother was."

"That's strange. It's easy enough to misplace a father, but not a
mother."

"It isn't that strange," Jack replied. "You've heard of the Crystal
Shade?"

Alfred gave a long low whistle of recognition. The Crystal Shade
was a whorehouse in the town proper.

"I've heard that the girls there take a malkemist potion that
ensures that they don't grow a bump."

Jack gave a half cock of his head. "Well, it must not work all the
time."

"I guess not," Alfred acknowledged wryly. "Still, I haven't even
heard whispers of any such."

Jack concentrated on rubbing down the mule, and Alfred let it lie.

The slowly extending silence was interupted by a smart tattoo of
knocks on the stable door. Alfred frowned in surprise and rushed to
his spy hole, only to grunt in consternation at what he saw.

"It's covered," he muttered, and then in a deep, strong voice
demanded, "Who is it?!"

"I am the terror that lurks in the dreams of the bold, the ghost of
true fear, the frightener of brave men, the siphon of souls,"
came a horribly rasped reply, "I am an abomination. I am Greon!"

The last was yelled with some force, but Jack kept his eyes on
Alfred's face, looking intently for some clue to the danger.
Alfred however, looked back at Jack and rolled his eyes, dispelling
Jack's tension.

Alfred lifted the bar on the stable door and drew it inwards.

"Welcome Master Greon, I'm sure Master Amoth is expecting you."

"Indeed, he may well be," rasped Master Greon, guiding a huge black
horse into the stable with his knees. His head was covered by his
malkemist hat and his face by a black scarf. In fact, between that
and his gloves, only his eyes were visible.

"What do we have here?" asked the man as he dismounted. "Did you
get yourself a helper Alfred?"

"Not in so many words, but he is quite handy."

"Has anyone else noticed that he has no shoes? He'll lose a foot to
this pre-spring chill or a horse if he's not careful."

"Doesn't seem to notice the cold," replied Alfred, "and I don't
think he's ever worn shoes. I guess we figured that if it was
good enough until now, then he's comfortable."

"Well, I hope he's got a strong stomach," rasped Greon. He pulled
at his scarf and began to unravel it.

Jack $recognised the challenge and watched. The first unwinding of
the scarf revealed two pits in a low mound where a nose should have
been. The flesh either side of the nose was layered with burn scars
that extended up and over the left eye, although the eye still
seemed to function. The flesh of the cheeks were terribly gouged
and uneven. Both ears were partially hidden by the malkemist hat,
but they looked to have been burnt away as well. The second unwind
revealed more scars and a mouth that seemed to have melted and sunk
on the right side. As the scarf was unwound until free, there was
no flesh revealed that was not covered by scarring except for a
splash, like a large patch, over his right eye.

Lastly, he pulled off his malkemist hat. No hair grew on his head,
as it too was completely covered in burn scars. The only hair on
his entire head was the eyebrows and eyelashes of his right eye. In
a startling contrast, his eyes were a deep and clear blue, giving
Jack the impression of a perfectly formed person staring out from a
deformed mask.

"Well, he's a tough one, I'll give him that. Even I flinch these
days when I accidently catch my reflection," he joked. Looking Jack
directly in the eye, he continued, "This isn't as bad as it was
though. Not so long ago I was able to stick my tongue out this
cheek," he pointed at the left side of his face, "that used to get
me the screams."

The way he rasped "screams" chilled Jack's blood.

Master Greon hacked a laugh, "I got him. See, he's gone white." He
petted his big black horse and warned, "Be careful with Tornado
here, he's got a mean streak," before heading for the house.

"Two soldiers from Hunter's Vale upstairs," Alfred called after
Greon, who nodded without turning back.

"Shaken?" asked Alfred when they were alone.

Jack shook his head.

"What happened to him?"

"That's his story, you'd have to ask him yourself."

"You don't know?" asked Jack in a polite tone, though he knew it
was a rude question.

Alfred refused to be prodded and cuffed Jack lightly behind the
ear. "I don't know all of it."

Jack put his hand on Tornado's shoulder and then slipped near to
put his shoulder and back to him. In line with Master Greon's
warning the big black horse tried to take a nip at him. Jack gave a
short bark of a chuckle and responded by tickling his chin.

"Have you been around many animals Jack?" Alfred asked, a
considering look on his face.

"No. The first time was when Halme threw..."

"Soldier Halme."

"Soldier Halme threw me on the back of his horse."

"Cats?" asked Alfred.

"I've seen a few cooked ones. Our people," Jack was referring to
shanty town people, "won't let a cat run from one end of town to
the other. That's what Mardy says."

"Yes, she's right. Of course," Alfred replied sheepishly. "But you
have dogs. They're a sacred animal," Jack looked up sharply from
his game with Tornado, "even the shanty towners wouldn't violate
the doctrines of the Cayophant. Dogs were companions to the one
true emissary of God."

"I wouldn't mind if people ate dogs instead," Jack responded
uncharitably.

Alfred snorted, "I'm not a devout man Jack, but you be careful with
your mouth outside this stable. People take their religion
seriously, even this far east."

There was a loud crash as the kitchen door struck the stone wall of
the corridor, and one of the malkemists who had escorted the boy
into the house came barrelling into the stable, his face contorted
with rage.

Tornado jerked backwards and lifted his nose high, almost pulling
his reins free from Jacks hands. Jack managed to keep his shoulder
against him and crooned as he had seen Alfred do. Alfred himself
got out of the way as the malkemist bore down on the stable door
and threw the bar back. The angry malkemist's left eye and cheek
were red and abraised, though the rest of his face was also
flushed. Jack only got a bare glimpse before he stormed out of the
stable.

Alfred rushed forward to stick his head out the stable door.
Satisfied that the malkemist had not lingered, he popped his bald
head back in. "See," he joked, "that's what happens when you don't
respect people's dogs. They get angry and throw tantrums."

"Someone hit him," Jack said, stroking Tornado.

"There's no putting anything past you Jack, I see that now," Alfred
mocked, "You could laugh at my jokes once in a while though. Leave a
man his face."

Alfred barred the door and then pulled the saddle and rug from
Tornado's back.

***

Soldier Halme came in before the evening meal, wearing a strange
cloak and no malkemist hat. He disappeared into the house without
pausing to greet anyone. Meanwhile, the malkemist who had stormed
from the house had not returned and Jack had no idea if he would
return or not.

Jack helped Minnie and Emily serve the diners in the dining room.
It seemed to be a busy night, with the visitors from Hunter's Vale,
Master Greon, and Halme rubbing shoulders with the usual assortment
of malkemists. The new boy did not even glance at Jack when he set
a plate in front of him. Jack wondered if he was pretending that
Jack was invisible, or if he was genuinely oblivious.

Emily was subdued as they returned to the kitchen and Minnie
reached out and petted her arm.

"Yes dear, it's a gruesome sight. I'd like to say I've seen worse,
but I'm not sure that I have. I don't know what's gotten into the
man. I much prefer it when he covers himself decently. What's he
trying to prove?" Minnie asked.

"He's gone through hell. You shouldn't begrudge a man a little
uncivil $behaviour," Alfred allowed.

"He doesn't need to listen to the likes of me on the topic, but
still," Minnie hurrumphed mildly. "It would be enough to turn me
off my food.

"I wonder if that's not his purpose."

Dinner was delicious as usual, and following Alfred's lead, Jack
told Minnie so. Minnie responded by pouring an extra nip of her
special brew into Jack's cup.

Alfred was in a jocular mood and took three coloured bean balls
from his vest to impress them with his juggling skills, and perhaps
to cheer up Emily. The balls flew into the air in the familiar
pattern of the street performers on the main way. Jack had watched
the street jugglers many times and could juggle himself, but he
appreciated it nonetheless. Importantly, the stableman did not
fumble a ball once.

They clapped for Alfred's performance.

"Are you going to gift us one of your songs Emily?" asked Minnie.
"We'll make a show of it."

"Perhaps later," replied Emily shyly, her eyes down and a blush on
her cheeks.

"I've already performed, and you've all eaten it up," Minnie laughed.
"I'd dance, but I'm too old for it these days."

Alfred turned to Jack. "And what of you lad? Any special skills
that we don't know of?"

Jack had already been wracking his brain. Prompted by Alfred's
juggling, he thought he might have an idea. He usually used the
skill far more pragmatically, but he supposed it could make a
passable trick.

"I can do something," he said nodding. "Do you have a silver piece
sirness?"

Alfred's eyes narrowed in amused caution. "Am I going to get it
back?"

Jack nodded, smiling.

Alfred pulled three silver pieces from a purse and handed one to
Jack. "There you go. I hope that wasn't the admission fee."

Emily laughed prettily.

Jack put the silver piece on his tongue in clear view of his
audience. He closed his mouth and let the silver slide down his
throat.

Emily gasped and Minnie started laughing.

"Ho, you'll get it back Alfred," Minnie laughed; then roared, "in a
couple of days!"

Alfred was looking a little green. Jack opened his mouth and moved
his tongue around to show that it was empty.

"No Jack! You didn't!" scolded a scandalised Emily. "Poor Alfred."

Alfred was taking the loss much more stoicly, but he was obviously
struggling with himself.

Jack felt for the coin in his throat and worked it back up into his
mouth. He sucked it dry as he withdrew it with his thumb and
forefinger.

The look of relief on Alfred's face was appreciation enough, but
both Emily and Minnie clapped and hooted. Jack went to the cistern
and washed the coin over the drain before drying it on his $pyjama
shirt and handing it back to Alfred.

"You had me good and proper lad. I was thinking of ways to knock it
out of you," said Alfred with a laugh. The comment caught on
Minnie's particular funny bone, and she laughed harder.

Their game of Contract began as soon as the dishes were washed, but
was soon interrupted by a call to the dining room to clear plates.
No sooner was that done than Master Amoth himself came into the
kitchen, Soldier Halme on his heels.

Jack heard Master Amoth's voice just before he pushed the kitchen
door inwards.

"...last thing we need. We don't want to frighten her."

Master Amoth gave Minnie a respectful nod, but addressed himself to
Alfred, "Alfred, could you drop the bar behind us please, we're
heading out."

Alfred abandoned his cards immediately and followed the two men
$towards the stables. They commanded so much attention that it was
a moment before Jack noticed Master Greon standing in the doorway
to the foyer.

"Come with me Jack," he rasped.

Minnie was frowning fit to break something on her face, but she
kept quiet as Jack followed Master Greon out into the foyer.

"Come," he beckoned with a heavy croak, drawing Jack $towards the
dining room.

The dining room was empty except for the two visitors from Hunter's
Vale. The boy looked up from his book and frowned at Jack as though
seeing him for the very first time. He shifted slightly in the
armchair he occupied by the fire. The soldier, for his part,
watched them enter attentively. Jack could almost see him gauging
distances and possible attacks.

"You may retire, Soldier Mond. I will be giving these boys a
lesson."

"I stay."

"No. You don't. Get out before I kick you out."

"It's my responsibility to see him safe to the highlands. The Grand
Imaginer will have something to say about this if you interfere
with my duty."

"I don't give a rats dinner what the Grand Imaginer has to say on
just about anything, let alone this. But if you stay, you will find
out exactly why the many men who have tried to kill me have failed.
That was your friendly heads up."

Very little about Master Greon could be mistaken for friendly.

Jack watched Soldier Mond flicker through anger, outrage, and then
uncertainty before coming to rest on fear. As soon as Jack
$realised what had just occurred he dropped his eyes to the throw
rug he was standing on and kept them there studiously. It was
unhealthy to watch a dangerous man backed into a corner and then
cowed. He did not peek up again until he heard Soldier Mond exit
and close the door behind himself.

"My father says you're an animal. That it would have been kinder to
put you down," the boy said, glaring at Master Greon.

Master Greon made a terrible noise. It took Jack a moment to
$realise that it was supposed to be a chuckle. "After all I've done
for the man. Last I checked, parents do not confer their rank on their
children." Rasping, clawing voice. "You'd best remember that, or
this lesson may prove more painful than most.

"Look at me, this is more than I've talked in months. I've parched
myself." He went to the dining table, poured himself some wine,
and took a healthy draught.

"Wine Jack?"

Jack shook his head, uncertain about exactly how much trouble he
was in right now.

***

Halme unwrapped two cloaks and handed one to Amoth. The night air
in the dark alley behind the house was cold and biting. He was
quite glad that he needed it as a disguise, though less impressed
with the sad quality of the garment. Still, it appealed to his
sense of the dramatic to be lurking the streets on a covert
mission, so the tatters and stains did not bother him as much as
they usually would have.

Amoth shrugged into his cloak with no evidence of such nonsense. He
was all business.

"Are you ready for your face?" asked Halme.

"Do the boots first. Who walks the streets with boots like these?"
he replied, gesturing to the immaculately maintained black leather
encasing his feet.

Halme nodded in agreement and quickly applied a scuffing villend to
their boots. The villend covered each boot and gave them the
appearance of age and hard wear. Halme was gratified by the result.
He loved his craft.

Halme could not help a slight upward curve of the lip as he applied
his selected facial disguise to Amoth. Amoth's cheek twitched with
discomfort and Halme could $sympathise, this type of villend really
gripped the face and gave the uncomfortable impression that the
face was actually being changed.

He handed Amoth a small hand mirror for him to view his handiwork,
the moonlight strong enough for him to make out details.

Amoth almost dropped the mirror with a cry, nearly making Halme
regret his joke. Nearly.

Amoth had been transformed into the spitting likeness of Master
Greon, disfigurements in place.

"That was not funny," Amoth scolded with a hard look at Halme.

"Trust me, it was funnier looking from the outside in," he
responded without the least hint of chagrin. He drew the living
villend back into its vill, and cast a new one back in its place.
"Better?"

The new face was the one Amoth had used before for this task. He
did not deign to gratify Halme with a response.

With both disguises in place they set off at a brisk walk.

"We need to be careful," said Halme. "It wouldn't do to be picked
up by the city guard in these clothes. They won't believe a word
out of our mouths."

"Surely you could handle them for us. A dozen guards should be a
light warm up for a psar soldier."

"Oh, and where would you be while I'm busy dispatching a dozen of
the Duke's finest?"

"Don't kid. They're hardly the Duke's finest. I'd be appreciating
your efforts and taking notes. I am a great appreciator."

Halme snorted crudely, but walked on in silence for a few moments.

"I've been hearing $rumours of war in the west, or more war if you
like," said Halme.

"I've heard the same thing. The western malclave has always been
far heavier handed than we are here in the east, but it feels
excessive. It seems they can't go a decade without a major upheaval
to thin the koyim."

"Umbral?" asked Halme.

Amoth tilted his head in disbelief, "You've actually heard that? A
myth. No such thing. Why would they exist in the west, but not
here?"

"I've heard stories of the umbral. Recent stories. Crazy stories.
Maybe someone is trying to bring the myth to life?"

"Stranger things can and do occur, but I can't believe that any
malkemist would turn against the docrine of the malclave. It's
impossible."

"Impossible for any properly initiated malkemist, but you're
presuming that all are properly initiated. It is a weakness to
believe that all other malkemists think like us," responded Halme.

Amoth looked to considered this for a moment. They paused at a
street corner to make sure there was no patrol before turning into
the crossing street.

"Varley, what crazy stories have you been hearing?" he sounded like
a man who did not really want to know.

"I've been hearing a lot of chatter about Pomede."

"Pomede!" Amoth exclaimed so loudly that Halme actually shushed
him.

"Pomede? What do children's stories have to do with anything?"
Amoth asked in a quieter voice.

Halme was a little embarrassed to go on, now that he had said it
out loud, "There's talk that a group of malkemists have been
searching for him."

He scratched bashfully at his brow.

"Let them search. If he is anything more than a myth, he's
almost certainly a thousand years in his grave. If not more.
Absolutely a myth. I'm quite sure he was invented by the earlier
Trium to scare any malkemist who managed to fool his way past the
gatekeepers. I'm starting to think that having you infiltrate the
Red Library has been a complete waste of your skills."

"Probably. They do little enough over there. Not to mention that we
are technically on the same side. Working under a different Grand
Master shouldn't make them our enemies."

"It's tiresome, I know. I certainly didn't start these rivalries.
Half the time it seems we are busy tripping ourselves up. One day
the western malclave is going to walk in here and take over while
we're busy duelling and spying." He gave Halme a pointed look.

"He had it coming."

They walked on through the town proper, the street sloping gently
downward. They passed a man selling grilled fish paste, the spices
strong enough to bite the nose. It smelled tasty, but he knew Amoth
did not eat street food, and he himself was not in the mood. A
little farther on they avoided an intense exchange between two
drunks in front of the River Queen, a well kept tavern. Halme had
drunk there himself.

"Maybe they're connected," mused Amoth suddenly. "The Umbrals and
Promede. I mean they must $idolise him. I've never really thought
about it before, but he stood for everything they stand for.

"Not that I think the Umbrals exist any more than than Promede did,
<i>but</i> if they do exist, then it stands to reason that they
would be interested in finding his dusty corpse."

"Oops, too late," Halme interjected incongruously into the
conversation, having just noticed a complication in their path.

Amoth turned on Halme to frown, only to catch sight of what he was
talking about. A troop of four city guards had just turned into the
street some distance ahead and were coming their way. Halme
straightened himself, trying to bring some authority into his
bearing. They would have breezed past the guards in a malkemist
hat. In fact, the guards would most likely have found a way to turn
from their path, rather than walk past them. But with the tattered
cloaks and no distinquishing marks, they were out of place here,
and fair pickings for the guards.

Halem focused on the approaching men. He was reading them. Though,
not with any malkemist skill. He was reading them with skills he
had developed long before he had every visited a malkemy academy.
This is what made him a good soldier. When other men were worrying
about things that may or may not happen, he was watching.

He felt more than saw Amoth flutter beside him. He was a bookworm
and a very clever man, but useless in bare conflict. Meanwhile,
Halme had found the leader, sized up two of the others as time
tickers—his own term for men with no interest in their own work—and
the last as one who might enjoy the use of his sword a tad much.

Halme adjusted his cloak, a cover for palming a vill from his inner
vest pocket. He could see that the leader's interest was peaked and
they would definitely be stopped. He waited until they were quite
close before, with an incidentally stalling hand on Amoth and an
unsteady stumble, he placed himself in front of Amoth.

"Halt." The leader put out a hand to bring them to a halt, and
Halme stumbled one last step to the man's left, which obliged him
to stop Halme with his outstretched arm.

Halme grunted with the roughness of the contact, which was all he
needed to spray a tiny amount of the villend into the leader's
face. He had positioned himself opposite the vigilant one, with the
leader between them as a shield. He recovered himself and offered a
flowery bow as apology for the contact.

"What are you doing here so late?" the leader queried angrily,
"The worker curfew begins an hour after dusk. You're going to be
spending the night in a damp hole."

"Is it so late, Captain?" queried Halme in a slightly slurred tone,
deliberately over-estimating the man's rank.

"Far later," said the leader coldly.

Halme swayed backwards and blinked his eyes at the rooftops, as
though clearing severely addled wits. "At any rate Captain, we are
not workers. We are artisans. Allow me to introduce myself," he
proclaimed, all the while watching the man's face for signs of
compliance.

"I am Master Pond, a skilled confectioner, and this is my
apprentice Pool." He gestured vaguely at Amoth, smiling inwardly at
the lowly role he had assigned the real master.

The leader stood still, as though weighing Halme's words, but Halme
knew better. He was befuddled. Taking advantage, Halme moved close
to the man and gave simple instructions that he would follow
promptly in his impressionable condition, then ostentaciously
pressed a silver coin into the leader's hand.

It was a real silver piece and Halme congratulated himself. The
others would definitely look for a cut of the bribe. <i>See, I can
be fair when the alternative doesn't see me dead.</i>

The other men in the little troop were not surprised at all when
the leader ordered them to move on.

"That was amazing. I didn't even see it happen, and I was watching.
You used a Voltis villend to make him suggestable, yes?"

"Sorry, I can't say," Halme replied. "Hunch over, you're walking
too proud. The lower town is filled with eyes and they're clever
enough to make someone who doesn't look right."

"What difference does it make if I walk straight or not?"

"You can lose the tone as well," replied Halme, not answering him,
as they moved off.

They passed through the wall that separated the inner town from the
outer town, and the cobblestones quickly gave way to crushed rock.

Halme staggered into Amoth and put his hand on his shoulder to
steady himself. He walked on using Amoth as a crutch, dragging his
feet and making the occasional misstep.

"Is that necessary?" whispered Amoth.

"Probably not, but two drunks attract less attention. I'd rather
not give anybody a reason to start asking the right questions."

They came to a building much like the others around it and climbed
some stairs to the first landing. Halme allowed himself to sober up
markedly. Amoth ducked into a long but very narrow corridor and went
straight to a particular door and Halme followed. There were voices
on the other side, but they quieted as soon as Amoth rapped his
knuckles on the thin wall.

"Who is it?" queried a deep masculine voice.

Halme had to restrain himself from responding with any number of
witty rejoiners. He may as well have been drunk.

"Brother Abel," Amoth said distinctly.

There was some scraping from within and the panel that closed off
the room within—it could not be called a door—was unlocked from
inside and pulled aside. A very pimply face appeared in the front
of them, attached to the brawny body of a quickly developing
teenager who worked like a man.

"Blessings of the One True Emissary on you," Amoth intoned piously,
"How are you kids settling in?"

"Good," answered Stine monosyllablically.

"Did you get the food Brother Mika sent?"

"Yes."

"Mind if we come in..." Amoth suddenly gripped his knee as though
in pain, and Halme supported him dutifully. "I need to sit down,
this knee is killing me."

Halme marvelled, he had not known that such deception came so
naturally to Master Amoth. Stine cleared the panel opening, and
Amoth and he entered. Although Stine hesitated, to his credit, he
eventually replaced the panel in its frame, making the small space
at once much more cosy. Especially he imagined, with two extra
grown men than it usually accomodated.

Halme got a good look at the others in the room by the single
flickering flame of candlelight. He had been the one to track them
down at the behest of Nuth, but this was the first time he was
seeing them up close. They were here now only because he had sent a
message to Amoth before he reported to Nuth. It would not have been
good for his work at the Red Library for him to fail at such a
simple task; on the odd chance that Nuth checked up on him. As it
was, he was fairly sure that Nuth already had his suspicions.

They were even more poorly dressed than the young Jack, if it were
possible. It finally dawned on Halme where the multitude of ragged
patches on Jack's coat and pants came from. The girl must use
discarded linens as patching material. Most of the patches were the
beige of well worn cotton sheets.

Halme grinned at the youngest, whose pants were made completely of
worn bedsheets. The little fellow grinned back to Halme's surprise.
He noticed some scabbed over sores under the boy's nose, but
otherwise he seemed healthy. The slightly older boy huddled by his
side had what looked like a blacksmith's leather cap on his head.
He did not grin back. The two of them did not look alike in any
way.

Mardy, the head of the family, was a very plain girl with a square
face and brown hair tucked away under a toque. She had wary,
untrusting eyes.

"Good evening, Miss Mardy. I've had our brothers and sisters of the
church on the lookout for your boy. Ah, what was his name?" asked
Amoth.

"Jack," supplied Mardy softly.

"Jack, yes, that's it. We've been looking, but I'm afraid we
haven't turned anything up yet. We were hoping you could give us
some more information that we could pass on. If we knew more, we
might be able to find him faster."

Mardy seemed skeptical, but she asked anyway, "What would you like
to know?"

"Well, how old is he if you know?"

"I know. I was there the day he was born."

"You saw him born then?" asked Amoth.

"No. Not exactly. But I know the day. He'll be eleven this spring."

"So you knew the mother?"

Mardy shook her head.

"The father?"

Another shake.

"But you said you were there?" pressed Amoth.

Mardy looked at the big boy and flicked her eyes at the two smaller
boys.

"Cover your ears numbnuts" the muscle bound near-man ordered the
boys. The older one scowled and the other poked his tongue out, but
they both put their fingers in their ears. The blacksmith cuffed
them both for good measure, and then pinned each to the floor with
a single thick finger on either belly. They giggled and squirmed,
but he cuffed them again if they forgot themselves and pulled a
finger out of their ears.

Mardy leaned in and whispered almost too softly to be heard. "I
took him from the Crystal Shade."

Halme nodded in understanding, but he noticed that Amoth was not
catching on. He leaned in and whispered the appropriate erudition
into the master's ear.

"Ah," Amoth breathed, his fake visage brightening from its
confusion. "They passed him to you."

"Not exactly sirness. It's more like they dropped him."

Confusion returned to the Master Amoth's disguised face. "Dropped?"

Mardy looked at the two small boys, and made sure they were
occupied before she continued. "They throw the babies down into the
sewer. Nobody knows. I heard it one day from a lady I collected
laundry from. Her face was puffy and she looked a mess. Those women
usually look so pretty, but not this one. Not that day. I asked her
what was wrong and she told me that they had thrown her baby into
the sewer. I didn't really understand. She told me and then she got
scared. She made me swear that I wouldn't tell anyone.

"I couldn't stop thinking about it. Eventually I went down into the
sewer to find out if her story was true or not."

Mardy's eyes were dry, but her face was bleak.

"It was easy to find. I could feel their bones under the water as I
walked. Some of them had been there so long that they broke under
my feet. I was only a little girl, but I followed the bones until
they stopped. Right under the Crystal Shade."

Mardy stopped talking for a moment. She just stared between the two
men. The moment stretched on. It would have been silent if not for
the restrained frolicking of the boys.

"Did you find her baby? Was it Jack?" asked Amoth.

Mardy shook herself and looked at Amoth, her expression confused
for a moment. "No. There was a new baby, but it was dead," she said
flatly.

Halme listened attentively as she continued.

"From that day, every time my mum sent someone to pick up laundry
at the Crystal Shade, I would go. But it was a month before I saw
her again, and she wasn't happy to see me when she did. I
threatened to tell people what she had said unless she told me when
the next baby would be dropped. She was angry. She wanted to beat
me. I was only small, but I was angry too. I scared her more than
she scared me.

"About a week later she told me that a Kashar woman was giving
birth. I couldn't get away from work and I was scared that the baby
would be dropped and I wouldn't be there to save it. But I got
there in time. Just in time. I got to the place just as they tossed
him in, and I caught him before he hit the sewer. He was bawling
and wet and naked, and I carried him out.

"I told my mum that a woman had given him to me. She asked if she'd
given me any money. She thought that I didn't know, but I did. She
thought that someone had tricked me, but I knew that women
sometimes paid the washer ladies to take a baby and drown it in the
river. I told her that the woman hadn't given me any money. She
said that she would take him somewhere and he would be taken care
of. I knew what she was going to do, so I didn't let him go and
eventually mum gave up.

"It made the washer ladies talk, but I was too young to have had a
baby for myself, so it wasn't so bad. I carried him with me
everywhere strapped to my back and Stine fetched ewe's milk for him
every day. Mum eventually got used to it and stopped grumbling."

"His mother was from Kashar?" Amoth asked.

"That's what Amorie said. I never asked anything about her."

"Any idea who the father..." Amoth began.

"Sirness? Really?"

"Oh, I guess not." Amoth conceded. "The other two?"

Mardy nodded once.

Amoth seemed satisfied and excused himself with polite assurances
that he, and his brothers and sisters, would leave no stone
unturned in the search for Jack. He fiddled with the panel for a
moment before pulling it free.

"You have everything you need Brother Abel?" Halme asked.

"Yes," Amoth answered as he stepped out.

Halme looked at Mardy for a serious moment, wondering if he should
give her a hard slap before leaving. It would be no kindness if
after this day they somehow thought that the Church of the
Cayophant was filled with charitable souls. Fortunately, she looked
back at him with bare suspicion, and he allowed himself to be
convinced that it was not necessary.

Outside in the brisk night air Amoth turned to him.

"I thought you had a sad story my friend," Amoth said, meeting
Halme's eyes.

Halme shrugged. "There's always a sadder story out there."

***

Jack thought that Master Greon winced with his final swig of wine,
but it was hard to tell. He put his glass down on the dining table
and pulled a vill from within his clothing.

"Can you identify this vill Corpa Demic?" Master Greon asked the cripple,
throwing it to him.

Demic fumbled the catch and had to retrieve the vill from the seat
cushion. "I don't have that skill. I can only feel what my own vills
contain," replied Demic in an edgy tone.

"Give it a go nonetheless. I would expect someone of your vaunted
potential could grow even more through practice than the rest of
us," Master Greon rebutted with a hint of mockery.

Demic closed his eyes and seemed to concentrate, but within a few
moments he opened his eyes again. "I feel nothing."

"Interesting. Jack, take the vill from Corpa Demic please,"
instructed Master Greon, pointing $towards the other boy with his
palm up.

Jack took a deep breath and approached Demic. He could feel deep
currents around him, but did not understand what anything meant.
Demic dropped the vill into Jack's hand, but did not acknowledge
him in any other way.

"Try to feel the vill Jack."

Jack closed his eyes and concentrated on the feel of the vill in
his hand. It was cool to the touch. He waited. He did not know what
very many of these did. He knew of the substance that the
malkemists used to protect themselves, but he did not know what it
was called. He knew what a rapid expander was, he had even used
one. He was suddenly filled with a strange certainty.

"Rapid expander," said Jack.

Master Greon's good eye blinked once. His face was not good at
expressing emotion, and Jack found him very difficult to read. He
cocked his head to the side and gestured for Jack to hand the vill
back to him.

The man stood still for several moments with the vill in his hand
before giving one short bark of some indeterminate emotion.

"Well blow me over. My mind doesn't want to accept it, but I can't
deny it."

Jack had no idea what he was talking about, and a look at Demic's
face said that he was equally puzzled.

"To a man with a hammer, every problem looks like a nail," Master
Greon croaked cryptically. "Would you care to try again Corpa
Demic?"

Demic cast a suspicious glance at Jack before nodding and accepting
the vill again. He closed his eyes, but opened them almost
immediately. "It is," he admitted with puzzlement.

He eyed Master Greon askance as he handed the vill back to the
master. If he desired answers, Master Greon was quick to put the
hope out of his mind.

"You may go Corpa Demic. By all accounts you have been studying
under your father to levels that others might consider unseemly in
the uninitiated. Though I'm not personally one to judge," grated
Master Greon.

Corpa Demic rose from his seat by the fire, inclined his head to
Master Greon briefly, and then left the room. He did not look at
Jack.

Master Greon sucked in a deep wheeze and took up the recently
vacated seat.

"It's so cold this far south," he whistled. "My bones don't
appreciate this weather at all.

"Take a seat Jack. I can't be staring up at you like this."

Jack took the seat opposite Master Greon by the fire.

"Do you know who that was?" asked Master Greon.

"Corpa Demic."

Master Greon snorted. It was an disconcertingly wet sound. "Yes,
that's his name, and yes, he is an uninitiated malkemist. What else
do you know?"

Jack almost shook his head, but then said instead, "He's crippled."

"Yes, he was born like that. He is also the son of a Grand
Imaginer. A lofty position among malkemists, and the son of one
enjoys every advantage. His disability might almost be viewed as a
balance to the otherwise fortuitous circumstances of his birth.
Some might say things like the sins of the father were visited upon
his son, but I'm not romantic enough to believe it.

"Apparently, he is the great crippled hope of malkemists everywhere
for reasons that you'll have to wait for an imaginer to explain to
you.

"Fetch me another glass would you Jack?" A friendly request made by
Master Greon bore the hallmarks of a poorly veiled threat of death
from another man and Jack leaped to obey. The wine sloshed terribly
in its carafe as Jack poured the wine, but he managed to fill the
cup without a spill.

Master Greon took a mouthful before he began to talk again.

"I used to be a handsome man. Not as handsome as say Soldier Halme,
but certainly not unpleasant to look at," he seemed to be
addressing his cup of wine.

Jack turned his imagination to the task of reconstructing Master
Greon's face. A sweep of clean smooth skin erupted and spread from
Master Greon's good eye. It covered and smoothed his ravaged face.
Hair grew in places that Jack had never seen hair on the man's
head. Before long his face matched his two clear blue eyes. He was
whole again. No longer repulsive.

Jack let the illusion go and blinked as the reality came rushing
back.

"You're a malkemist, can't you just fix your face?" Jack asked.

"Fix my face?" Master Greon asked. His rasping voice made it
impossible for Jack to tell if he was angry or not.

"Isn't there a vill that could heal you?"

"Probably, but none that I have access to. Our healing vills work
by stimulating the body to heal itself, but these are not just
burns, they are a corruption too. It was rather clever if you look
at it in a clinical way." Master Greon's tone said that he saw it
in anything but that way.

"There are other ways, but they are forbidden by custom and law
within the malclave."

Jack could hear the simmering resentment in the malkemists voice.
The anger. He wondered if he was getting better at judging Master
Greon's rasping speech.

"I could always smear my face with a carefully crafted illusion,
but I see no reason to spare anybody the sight of my face. If I
have to live with it from dawn to dusk, others can handle it a few
moments each day.

"What do you really know about malkemists Jack?" Master Greon
queried suddenly. "You should have some knowledge, since it seems
that you will be propelled into this world sooner rather than
later.

"What? I shouldn't have said that?" he continued before Jack could
answer, his head turned to the side as though listening to a
disembodied voice. "Blah! What do I care? Well Jack, what do you
know? What do you really know?"

Jack did not really know much at all and it made him nervous to be
placing his ignorance on display. He braced himself.

"Malkemists use the air, water, and earth to work their magic. They
can kill a man at a distance, track people halfway around the world,
heal any wound, read people's minds, fly," Jack said it all in a
rush and then fell silent.

Master Greon offered up his croaking laugh. It seemed to pain him,
but he did it anyway.

"If only that were true," he said once his laughter subsided,
"being a malkemist would be a lot more fun than it is. I'd like to
be able to fly, that's for sure. And being able to heal any wound
might have proven useful, for obvious reasons. Unfortunately, I
can't fly. I can't read your mind. I can only track you over a
limited range, and then only if you have left some physical trace
that I could use."

He laughed again, "And if I could kill men at a distance, there
would be a lot less dead men walking."

"Dead men can't walk," Jack blurted impulsively.

"No?" Master Greon queried as though it were a serious contention,
"They can when they don't $realise they're dead yet.

"It seems the only thing you got right was that we use water. We
do. Water has been a magical substance since before the tenolists
lost control of their $civilisation and plunged the koyim into
their current state. We take advantage of its transformative
capacity to create almost anything we can conceive. Unfortunately,
the human capacity for creation is rather limited and we find
ourselves to be mere copiers of the real creator or creators.
Monkeys with a shiny tool. We are also limited in how long our
creations endure. Unless the fickle spirit of life inhabits
something that we create, it soon degenerates back to the
$energised water it comes from. I can spin gold from a puddle in
theory, but in practice it would not last long enough for me to
spend it. And in an irony that you must appreciate, lest it drive
you to impotent rage, every malclave I know of forbids its
malkemists from creating life. Especially human life.

"Yes, yes, I know it's necessary," growled Master Greon, talking to
himself again. He drank wine and stared moodily into the fire.

The minutes dragged by with Jack in attendance and Master Greon
lost in contemplation of either wine or flame.

At length he muttered throatily, "... and healthy body."

He was asleep.

Jack took some time to make sure that Master Greon was truly asleep
before he eased himself out of the deep armchair and tiptoed to the
door. He let himself out with barely a whisper.

---

Jack woke the next morning with a sense of excitement. Life was
starting to look much more positive than it had ever looked before
and he was in a rush to see what the new day would bring.

He looked down at his brown $pyjamas and for the first time since
he had arrived in the house, he did not miss his own coat. His
dusty, frayed, and patched grand coat. He did not even think on it.

He greeted Minnie cheerfully and set about fetching water for the
reservoir. On the way to the well he poked his head into the stable
to say good morning to Alfred, only to find him absent. The horses
from Hunter's Vale were also gone, but that was fine by Jack. The
boy, Demic, did not like him, and the soldiers were dangerous.

He strained his muscles with relish pulling water from the well and
hauling the heavy pail inside.

"Jack!" squealed Emily on one of his turns in the kitchen. "We have
something for you."

He had not completely filled the reservoir and he was caught
between wanting to finish the job and finding out what surprise
Miss Emily had in store for him.

Minnie settled it by ordering him to put the pail down and get his
butt to the table. He did as instructed.

Emily stepped aside to reveal a large, neatly wrapped, brown paper
package tied with string. She had a cheeky grin on her face that
said she knew something that Jack did not.

"Go ahead, open it," she invited, her eyes twinkling.

"And be quick about it," said Minnie, her face stern. "Some of us
have work to do after this foolishness."

Jack untied the knot slowly and pulled the strings free. He had to
flip the bundle over to find the paper seam to open it up on.
Despite the irregularity and softness of the package, the brown
paper had been smartly creased.

The inside was filled with clean, crisp cloth.

Emily could not contain herself a moment longer. "Quick Jack," she
encouraged, "slip out of those $pyjamas. I want to see how they
look!"

Jack did as he was told and Emily soon had him in a pair of
underpants—as she described them—with a drawstring. They felt
terribly uncomfortable and he itched to take them off, but he dared
not offend Miss Emily.

"...looks ready to crawl out of his skin. I warned you that you
can't just slip a street rat into finery and expect anything but a
rat in a suit," Minnie commented.

Emily spurned her cynicism, and continued by slipping a pair of
trousers over the top of the underpants and cooed at the fit. Jack
could not care less about the fit, and was completely engrossed by
how clean and new they were. There were no white patches or stains
of varying shades of $grey. No gaping rents in the fabric. No
frayed seems. It was smooth and perfect. He was scared to touch
them.

He completely forgot about how uncomfortable his underwear felt.

Next came a white linen shirt, plain and clean, but with tiny fox
heads embroidered on the cuffs. Jack could barely contain the
thoroughness of his pleasure. He ignored how the collar chafed his
neck.

"...handsome foxes, I wonder whose idea that was?"

Emily tucked his shirt into his pants and buttoned them up.

"Sit Jack," she instructed, pulling a pair of stockings from the
still substantial pile of clothing. "Woolen stockings," she
explained with a grin at him. She rolled them up in her hand and
then rolled them out onto his bare feet. They felt soft and warm.

Emily smiled mischievously and took a second brown paper package
from Minnie, who was also smiling. She handed it to Jack.

"Go on, open it."

Jack pulled the knot free as before and unbundled the package. He
smelled leather immediately and his heart skipped a beat. Inside
were a pair of black leather boots. Emily did not wait for him to
get a good look at them. Instead, she plucked one from his lap and
began pulling the laces loose. She pushed it onto his right foot
and then began on the second. It was quite a production, but
eventually she had both laced up, and invited him to try them out.

They were heavy on his feet and he stumbled slightly as he climbed
down from the stool. They were so heavy. <i>Terrible for climbing on
rooves</i>, he thought. He took a few steps and stumbled again.
Emily giggled.

"You'll get used to them Jack, don't worry," Emily assured.

"He cuts a fine figure now, to be sure, but it'll be finer still
with this," said Minnie holding up a new coat.

Jack stared at it for a moment, feeling a sudden sharp melancholy
for his old coat. This was a far finer coat than his, even on
its best day, and it had known its best day long years before it
had come into Jack's possession. Still, it was his, and it was
familiar. It had felt like a part of him, and now that it was gone,
a part of him was missing.

"Come on boy, don't leave us waiting, put your arm in," said
Minnie, holding the coat open at shoulder level for Jack to slip
into.

Jack did as he was told and was rewarded by a gasp of delight from
Emily. She clasped her hands in front of her and practically jumped
up and down on the spot.

"We've transformed him into a young lord Minerva!" Emily cried with
delight.

"Not us, lovely girl. It wasn't us who commissioned all this
finery."

"You can be a terrible wet rag sometimes Minnie," complained Emily
with a feigned pout. "Let me enjoy this as though it's mine for a
bit."

She fussed at the fall of Jack coat for a few moments,
straightening imaginary wrinkles, and for a wonder Minnie held her
tongue.

"You're very handsome Jack. Very handsome. It's a good thing we
don't have any girls your age around here or we'd have to beat them
off with a stick," Emily said, winking at him affectionately.

"Oh my," said Alfred from the door. "Master Amoth has given me the
task of teaching Jack to ride this morning. We'll be mugged if he
goes out like that. I don't fancy taking a polearm to the back just
so some idiot can discover he has empty pockets."

"True enough," said Minnie. "Unless you're in the company of
malkemists, those clothes are an invitation to ruin."

"Never fear, it isn't all frills and flare. We have some practical
clothes in here as well," rejoined Emily. She set to work laying
out a new outfit for Jack in plain brown woolens and leather.

"How's the weather today?" she asked Alfred.

"Fair, if chill."

"I don't think the cold will bother Jack, but if it looks like rain
he'll need an oiled cloak."

"No rain on the horizon Miss Emily. He'll be fine in that."

She changed him quickly into some woolen slacks, an unbleached linen
shirt, and a leather jerkin.

"Still handsome," she winked.

"Come Jack, we don't have much time. Let's skedaddle," cajoled
Alfred.

In the stable, Alfred led a deep brown coated mule out of a stall.
It was the first time that Jack had seen the animal.

"She's all yours Jack, so you had best get acquainted. You'll have
to saddle her up yourself, since you'll be doing it without me soon
enough. Her tack is hanging on the high bar there."

Alfred fetched the horse he usually rode on errands and began
saddling him.

"Her name is Risle, it rhymes with gristle, and she's twice as
tough. I bought her from a man I trust yesterday. She's been well
taught and ridden in. A perfect first mount. You'll be as safe as a
dog in church."

The first thing Jack did was to check her feet and then her teeth,
much to Alfred's amusement.

"Don't you know it's rude to look a gift mule in the mouth Jack?"
asked Alfred with a laugh. "It's good. I'm happy enough," he said
after Jack sent him a look of consternation, "It's a solid instinct
to cling to. A good horse—or mule in your case—can be the
difference between life and death sometimes. Carry on."

Jack finished his inspection.

Taking her riding blanket from the rail, he petted her, though she
was already standing calmly, and then slipped it on her back. It
was her blanket, Jack could tell because it already smelled like
her. He struggled to pull the saddle off the rail and then managed
to slap himself in the ribs with a wayward stirrup. He winced at
the impact, but got on with it by pulling the stirrup over the seat
$towards himself and then transferred the saddle to Risle's back.
She did not so much as stir a hoof.

"Good girl," Jack murmured, rubbing her chest.

He tightened the cinch strap, replaced her halter with a bridle,
and adjusted the stirrups with the same ease.

"She has some saddle bags there as well, but you won't need those
today," explained Alfred, leading his horse to the stable door.

In the alley, Alfred invited Jack to mount. Jack rubbed Risle's
shoulder and transferred the reins to the back of her neck and tied
them together there. Risle's ears were much longer than a horses,
just like Demic's mule, and Alfred had warned him that their ears
were sensitive. He went to put his left foot in her stirrup, but
misjudged the new height of his sole. He failed twice before he
compensated properly for his new boot. He put his left hand on the
pommel and prepared to pull himself up. Risle promptly took a short
step away and stopped, leaving Jack stretched out so that he had to
put his foot down again.

Alfred chuckled, but said nothing.

Jack, not wanting to be made a fool of twice in a row, did not try
that again. Instead, he came around to her large head and stroked
her nose gently. He looked into her large brown eyes and breathed
his warm breathe into her nostrils, the way he had seen Alfred do
once or twice. She regarded him intently, but gave no indication of
acceptance or rejection.

Jack returned to her flank and put his foot in the stirrup, waiting
for her next move. She stayed still, and Jack swung up onto her
back.

"That was good Jack. You're a quick study. That was the exact right
thing to do with a mule. You don't want to be on her bad side, not
ever. It is easy to make a life long enemy of a mule, but once you
have her loyalty, she'll never leave you. I'm not saying you're
there, but you're on the right track."

Alfred looked at Jack's stirrups. "You're set your stirrups too
low. I'll pull them up for you."

He led his horse alongside and made some quick adjustments before
going to the other side. Jack felt a lot more secure in the saddle
once he was done.

"Let's go. Don't try to steer her, listen first. She's smart enough
that she'll guess what you want better and quicker than you can
tell her with the reins," advised Alfred. "I've seen riders forego
a bridle and steer a mule with their knees and a few clicks of the
tongue. They're a smart animal, try not to forget it."

Alfred mounted and led off, and Risle followed. A corner of Jack's
mind was worrying about the Red Library or even someone eyeing Jack
and reporting it back to Marten. He wondered if Alfred had really
thought this little jaunt all the way through, but before the fear
had taken root, Alfred turned $towards the $centre of town and away
from the shanty. He began to relax into his seat a little and enjoy
the ride.

His anxiety returned somewhat with the many faces on the morning
streets. He was a nocturnal creature, and had only very rarely
visited the town proper in daylight, and then only very carefully.
The whole place felt a lot safer to him in the dark. It was also
quite strange to look down on people from the back of a horse. They
seemed smaller, less threatening.

Some part of him was expecting a guard to jump out from among
constantly changing mix of faces and pull him from Risle.  They
would know that he was a boy from the shanty and they would react
the same way they always did. Badly.

However, once he had passed two individual guards in uniform, he
began to lose his fear. They really could not tell that he was Jack
the thief. All they saw was the mule and the clothes. There was
still far too many faces popping up at him, but he could handle
that.

With the occasional word of advice from Alfred, Jack slowly learned
to give control over to Risle.

"It's good that I've caught you now, and not after you've been
riding for a couple of years," Alfred commented. "Bad habits can be
terribly difficult to break once you have them. But you don't have
any habits at all."

"Where are we going Alfred?" Jack asked.

"To the royal park. Where else?"

Jack felt a shiver of fear. He had never been to the royal park,
and for good reason. The royal park was stocked with deer and boar
and rabbit for the sport of the Duke and his guests. To be caught
in the royal park was as good as a death sentence and the parkers
were not as lax as the town guard when it came to enforcement. At
least he would not have to worry about any of Marten's rats up
there, they would not dare. Nor malkemists he presumed. That still
did not make him particularly happy to be going in that direction.
<i>How does Alfred expect to just wander into the royal park?</i>
he wondered.

"You're not bothered by the height?" Alfred asked.

"No."

"Most first time riders feel fear, you're further from the ground
than you usually are. You don't feel it?"

"No."

All too soon they arrived outside the black wrought iron gate of
the park. It was closed fast against casual entry, but Alfred
ignored the closed gate and pitched his voice for someone within
the park. Beyond the gate, Jack could see trees as far as the eye
could see. Jack was struck by how beautiful it looked. Healthy and
fresh.

"Ho! Criman? You there?" called Alfred.

"Yes, yes. Coming sirness!" came the slightly panicked reply.
Moments later a portly middle-aged man in the brown uniform of a
parker came into view.

"Argh! You gave me a bad turn Alfred, you rascal. I thought you
were someone important," said the parker, a knuckle moving to rub
one bleary eye. He then rubbed his palms on his thighs as though
ridding himself of an itch and began fiddling with the gate.

"Not important?" Alfred asked rhetorically. "That hurts." He did
not sound hurt.

Criman laughed, making no apology.

"You'd best be done by midday, the word is the Duke will be down to
hunt with his nephew this afternoon. Not a problem unless he's in a
bad mood, but why tempt fate," warned Criman. He opened one side of
the gate to let Alfred and then Jack through.

"Enjoy your ride. I'm going to catch some shut-eye," said Criman.
He promptly disappeared into a camoflaged hut.

"Follow my lead Jack," said Alfred. His horse broke into a trot.

While Jack was wondering how he could push Risle to do the same,
she took the initiative and gave chase. Jack was forced to grab the
pommel to avoid sawing at the reins.

He bounced around terribly, his bum coming down and striking the
saddle just as it was coming up. Every time. No matter what he
tried, he was thrown back into the air on the very next stride. He
wondered if he was annoying the mule, but she seemed to be enjoying
herself. He was very grateful that Alfred's back was to him, his
eyes fixed ahead, so he could not see Jack make a complete fool of
himself.

Alfred rode with grace. Horse and man seemed to take each stride
together. Neither seemed to be straining, though Jack had precious
little attention to spare as he struggled just to stay in his seat.

Suddenly, and for no reason that Jack could see, Alfred's horse
slowed to a walk and then stopped. And so did Risle, though Jack
was wholely unprepared for a stop. He ended up leaning wildly to
the left and almost slid from his seat completely as she came to
rest. He clung on for dear life, the reins completely forgotten. As
was his dignity.

"What have you got there Alfred?" asked a deep male voice. "Times
lean? Making a income on the side teaching lordlings to ride?"

"Hardly Descart," laughed Alfred. "This is a one off. Need him
ready to ride by tomorrow."

"You've got your work cut out for you then. That bag of potatoes
was all over the place. I think you'll have to tie him to his
saddle if you want to get him anywhere safely," the big voice
chuckled.

"That bad?" Alfred entertained.

"Oh yeah."

Jack had gathered himself back into his seat enough to identify the
voice. In front of Risle was one of the biggest men Jack had ever
seen. In fact, he looked less like a man than something carved from
an oaken bough. His face was sepulchral. A skull with just enough
flesh stretched over it to remind men that he was human. His frame
looked lean and sparse, but only because it was so tall. Otherwise,
his arms were thick and sturdy. He had a parker's uniform on and
his green cap, complete with feather, sat at an odd jaunt. If Jack
had felt any need of confirmation of the giant's strength, the
strung bow in his hand was almost as tall as the man, and set in
his quiver were the thickest and longest arrows that Jack had ever
seen. It reminded him of the first time he had caught sight of
Minnie. The same sense of awe gripped him.

Descart stepped before Risle and rubbed his enormous mitt against
her forehead. Risle, to her credit, held her ground and did not
shy. Jack was staring into the man's deepset eye sockets between
Risle's long pointed ears.

"A bold mule for a bold boy. They make a perfect match Alfred. Was
that your idea?"

"I chose her for him. I got the same vibe from the both of them."

"It was a good choice. Criman told you the Duke will be here in the
afternoon?"

"Yep. We'll be long gone by then," replied Alfred.

"Good. Good. I'll leave you to it then. Good luck lad."

It was only when Descart began to walk away into the trees that
Jack noticed that another, much more reasonably proportioned man,
had been standing there with him all along. They both disappeared
quickly into the folliage.

"Varley Jack. That was fun, but this time I'll give you some
instruction before sacrificing you to the saddle god," joked
Alfred. "You'll need to relax into your seat and balance yourself.
Quick, practice this."

Alfred stood up in his stirrups and then lowered himself back down.
He did it several times and then asked Jack to do the same.

"See, you can't stand up if you're not balanced. Find your balance
first and then everything else will follow. No. No. Don't just
plonk yourself down! Use your knees to slide back into the saddle,
just a little each time. You don't want to be jarring your butt on
every landing. Varley, that's a little better. Let's try another
trot. Oh, and be ready to push your feet forward when she comes to
a stop. Same if she takes off, you'll need to push your feet back.
Any other time, you'll want to be somewhere in the middle.

"You want to be balanced over the stirrups, but you don't want to
be bobbing up and down like a cork in a bottle, not click after
click. You'll wear yourself out and you'll wear out your horse. The
idea is to move with your horse just enough to not be working
against her. You'll need a good connection with your stirrups to
achieve it. You need to relax, but not so much that you're a dead
weight in the saddle. That's not helpful. Got all that? Good, off
you go.

"Whoa, wait. I almost forgot. Keep the balls of your feet on the
stirrups, and the outside of the stirrup to the front."

Alfred pulled alongside, seemingly without prompting his horse to
do so, and shifted Jack's foot in its stirrup for him.

"Do the other one yourself and then off you go."

Jack adjusted his other foot and then sat there for several moments
feeling silly for several moments before asking Alfred.

"How do I do that?"

"Oh, sorry Jack, did I miss that?" Alfred asked, a twinkle in his
eye. You can direct her with your legs."

Alfred touched Jack's knee and explained.

"You shouldn't touch her with your leg from here down unless you're
giving her a command."

Alfred spent some time explaining the leg and seat commands that
Risle was trained to respond to, dazzling Jack with how many there
were and the subtleties between them.

With some trepidation, Jack gently pressed Risle's sides with both
calves, and was amazed when she began walking forward. Once he felt
her respond, it was only a matter of moments before he put her into
a trot. Unfortunately, Alfred's patient instruction went out the
window immediately as Jack struggled to keep his seat. Jack
imagined he could feel amusement radiating from Risle.

"Keep your weight in the stirrups! Follow her rhythym!" called
Alfred from afar.

After several hundred meters, Jack managed to slow her to a walk
and push her around with a leg as Alfred has shown him. He felt
lucky to have stayed in the saddle. He looked around at the green
grass and the many trees and regretted that he had no time to enjoy
it.

On the way back he lifted her to a trot, and this time took a few
strides in harmony with Risle's gait. But just as he thought he had
it, he fell out of step and started bouncing around again.  He
reached Alfred with a red face.

"What have you stopped for?" asked Alfred. "Get back to it. Keep
your back straight and stomach tight."

Up they trotted again. This time Jack felt the rhythym a couple of
strides in and kept it going. He made it to where he had come
before, and instead of stopping, decided to swing her around in a
wide arc to ride back.

The turn proved too much for him. He lost a stirrup—he cursed the
deadening boot on his foot—and then his balance, and without
warning he was flying free through the air. He hit the ground,
tumbled, and was back on his feet before Risle pulled herself up.

He gave her a pat, mounted up, and trotted back to Alfred. Alfred
was shaking his head as Jack approached.

"I've never seen anyone fall from a horse with such grace. You're
much better at falling than you are at riding. This time give a
gallop a go."

"Go faster?" asked Jack dubiously.

"Don't worry, riding a gallop is much easier than riding a trot,
even a slow trot. Just stand and balance on the balls of your
feet. She can wear you out in the trot, but she'll wear herself out
at a gallop."

Jack did as he was told and almost immediately regretted it. Risle
could move like the wind. He was wondering if he should be scared
or not when he $realised that riding her like this really was much
easier. Suddenly the speed was a thrill, not a threat.

He made it to the other end of their run and slowed her to a walk.
He gave her a hearty couple of pats on the shoulder, and set her
off $towards Alfred at a trot. He was grinning like a madman.

"You liked that, eh?" teased Alfred.

Jack's grin turned sheepish, but did not subside.

Alfred did not let him gallop again, so as not to wear Risle out,
but they practiced the trot several more times. Each time with some
more specific instruction from Alfred. Side stepping from left to
right, or turning at a trot, or stopping and turning on the spot.
Jack was feeling the strain, but was exhilarated nonetheless.

"Off your mule Jack," Alfred demanded suddenly at the end of a run,
his face creased with concern.

Jack hopped down, wondering if there was something wrong with
Risle. But as his feet his the ground he heard the tattoo of hoof
beats behind him and turned to see five riders bearing down on
them. Alfred dismounted too and led his horse out to meet the
riders. Jack stayed where he was, he $recognised the Duke's
personal guard, if not the Duke himself. He felt a thrill of fear.
<i>This is not good.</i> By himself, this would mean death. With
Alfred, he was not yet sure.

Alfred went down on one knee, his reins over a shoulder. Jack
followed suit, letting go of Risle because he couldn't quickly
untie her reins. He copied Alfred's bowed head. The air filled with
the sound of hooves, squeaking tack, and the soft jangle of metal.

"State your business in his Lordship's park," demanded a gravelly
voice as soon as the horses had pulled to a halt.

"I've been tasked with teaching Corpa Jack here horsemanship by the
master of Sparrow Library," replied Alfred calmly without lifting
his head.

"This lad?" asked the voice.

"Yes."

"At least he seems to know his place, not like the rest of that
wretched lot," piped in another, younger voice. Jack did not dare
raise his head to see the face.

"Now, now, nephew. The malkemists are a valued segment of our
society, if they overstep their bounds on occassion, they do so
with the best of intentions. I'm sure," said an older, fuller
voice. "The crown has no quarrel with Sparrow Library. If only they
could all be as unobstrusive.

"Descart!"

Within moments the large parker presented himself at a lope from
the tree line.

"Descart, are these visitors members of Sparrow Library as they
claim?"

"They are, your lordship."

"That's good enough for me then. Come nephew, you'll enjoy the
sport I've prepared for you."

Several calls of "hurraw" filled the air and the horses exploded
into motion, galloping past Alfred and Jack with their tails high.
Descart gave a slight shrug Alfred's way and then took up an easy
flowing run in pursuit of the horses.

Jack was shaken, and not yet certain why he was still alive. Alfred
strode over and gave Jack a hearty slap on the back, releasing some
of Jack's nervous energy.

"Well handled! Though I guess it comes naturally to you,
considering. It would be easier to break a three-year-old stallion
than convince a corpa to take the knee most times. But it smoothed
things over nicely."

Jack just nodded and gave Risle a few idle pats.

"Let's be getting back. You've taken on a lot today. Better to
sleep on it and have a fresh mind tomorrow," said Alfred.

"Why don't they give him a horse?" asked Jack.

"Who?" asked Alfred, his foot in the stirrup.

"Descart. They make him run after them like that."

Alfred snorted as he swung himself up. "That man could run those
horses into the ground any day of the week. Probably two or three
times over. A man has far more endurance than a horse Jack, and can
travel further in a day. We're a hardy animal. Perhaps the
hardiest. Don't you worry about Descart one bit."

Jack swung up into the saddle and they turned $towards the park gate.

As they approached the gate, Criman came rushing out to greet them.

"Alfred, you beautiful man!" he cried. "You saved me. If you hadn't
woken me up I'd have been fast asleep when the Duke arrived. It
makes my knees tremble to imagine it. Thank you. Thank you."

"You could always try sleeping during the night instead," smirked
Alfred.

"Eh!? The night is for other things Alfred," he said, laughing at
his own lewdness.

"It's your hide," replied Alfred as he and Jack rode through the
gate. "Look after yourself."

A short time later, they were home safe in the Sparrow Library stable.

"Where did the riders from Hunter's Vale go?" Jack asked as he
rubbed Risle down after her ride.

"They took up at an inn nearby," replied Alfred.

Jack understood perfectly why that was the case and did not need to
ask any more questions. Master Greon was not a comfortable man to
be around, even at his rosiest, and he seemed to have some history
with at least one of the malkemists from Hunter's Vale.

He pitched fresh straw into Risle's stall before locking her in.

---

Jack felt distinctly uneasy as Minnie placed a tray full of food in
front of him. The dining room took on a completely different aspect
from the vantage of a guest, and he had no idea where to look when
she took the white napkin from his tray, flapped it open, and laid
it on his lap.

Master Amoth sat at the head of the table, chatting amicably with
an elderly malkemist who Jack did not know. Across the table, at
Master Amoth's right hand, sat Master Greon, though not as Jack was
used to seeing him. Tonight he wore a disguise that hid his
disfigurments. In fact, Jack had mistaken him for a new malkemist
entirely until he had opened his mouth to speak.

Archivist Melanie sat on Jack's right, writing out another twenty
words on his small scrap of paper. Sitting next to Master Greon,
and opposite Jack, were another two malkemists that Jack had not
been introduced to, though he noticed them eyeing him as he
fidgetted.

With the evening meal served, Minnie and Emily retreated from the
room, though not before Emily sent a surreptitious wink in Jack's
direction.

Archivist Melanie passed back his piece of paper and Jack slipped
it into the pocket of his shirt. It now held one hundred and twenty
words.

Master Amoth invited everyone to eat and Jack followed suit, taking
care to apply the lessons that Minnie had drilled into him. He
discovered, to his delight, a cup on his tray that contained
Minnie's special brew. No one else on the table had the same cup
and Jack smiled slightly as he sipped the potent concoction.

The meal was delicious, as always, but Jack was soon missing the
kitchen. The malkemists around the table were discussing the world
outside Corsisan, and he was quickly lost in the folds of the
conversation. He knew some of the cities mentioned by name, but
most were a buzz of unfamiliar syllables. They seemed to be
discussing trade and money, though some of the things said made no
sense in that context at all.

"Whatever happened to our guests from Hunter's Vale?" asked the
malkemist beside Melanie innocently. "I expected them here tonight.
They're leaving for Pamsley tomorrow, yes?"

"I'm afraid they elected to remain in the comfort of the Tranquil
Inn over on Mange Street. They do have an early start tomorrow and
several days ride in front of them. I guess they wanted to be as
prepared as possible," replied Master Amoth.

Jack noticed Archivist Melanie flick her eyes up at Master Greon,
but his features were as immobile as ever. The disguise, though it
hid his scars, did not make him any more expressive, and therefore
readable. Though he did seem to carve away at his roast with
renewed relish, and the two malkemists opposite Jack shared a
meaningful glance.

Silence reigned amid the soft scrape of utensils for several
moments before the malkemist directly opposite Jack, a man with a
soft, kind face broke it with a question.

"Corpa Jack, I heard that you had the pleasure of meeting the Duke
this afternoon. How was your brush with royalty? Your first I
presume?"

Jack looked up the table at Master Amoth and then swallowed his
food.

"I didn't see his lordship, master. I kept my head down."

"Lordship?" scoffed the malkemist. "He should call you his
lordship, though you're no malkemist yet. And I'm a humble imaginer
Jack, not a master."

"You did well Jack," broke in Master Amoth. "Handling the royals
that rule over the koyim is always a delicate game. Pressing one's
hand with nothing to play can end badly."

Jack was not quite sure if there was a mild rebuke in his words for
the imaginer.

"How is your work with the Church going Lorast?" asked Master Amoth
after a short silence.

The malkemist next to soft-face cleared his throat roughly.

"It is probably a terrible overstatement to call it work, we guide
only. The Church is stable. No undue developments to get excited
about. Though I'll be happier when your wife returns, and I can
hand responsibility back to her."

"Where is Belinda?" asked Master Greon suddenly in his croaking
drawl. "I can't believe I'm only asking now. How rude of me."

Master Amoth turned and looked at Master Greon with a soft snort of
amusement.

"Belinda is down at the coast, at Eelong, strengthening their
church."

"Dangerous city. Who did you send with her?"

"She is more than capable of taking care of herself, as you know,
but she did take Davran and Estar. They'll have no trouble at all."

"We've all seen her in action. She's a handy woman, but everyone
needs someone at their back. The days of wandering the countryside
with robe and staff are long gone. There seem to be real enemies
growing in every quarter."

"If you meant to turn me off my food Greon, you're on the verge of
managing it," said Master Amoth, laying his knife and fork by the
side of his plate. He perched his elbows on the table and dry
washed his hands in front of himself.

Jack practically goggled at the clear violation of Minnie's very
clear rules on ettiquette, but no one else seemed to mind.

"There is a lot of talk of unrest and danger, but looking through
it, I can't find an instance of any trouble that hasn't been the
result of our own mischief," stated Master Amoth. "Please anyone,
correct me if I'm wrong.

"We've had recent skirmishes with other Libraries, but that's
obviously an internal matter. The koyim are no more active than
usual." Master Amoth's hand separated for emphasis. "The ever
present threat of encroachment by the western malclave seems not to
be the problem we once thought it was. I don't see what all this
talk of danger is about."

"The world is changing. It doesn't look like much is happening,
you're right there, but I feel a change in my bones," rebutted
Master Greon.

Master Amoth pursed his lips and looked as though he wanted to say
something more, but took up his utensils and began eating instead.

"Master Amoth, I am deeply curious to know what you have discovered
about the abilities of our newest library member. What little I
have heard has been quite fascinating," said Lorast.

"It's a complete mystery to us Lorast, we have, thanks to the
somewhat zealous efforts of Master Greon, verified the phenomena,
but not why or how it occurs," Master Amoth replied.

Master Greon ignored the mention of his name.

"You're convinced he can do it? He can change the function of a
villend?"

Amoth nodded.

"It should be impossible. I couldn't do the same with a plith
crystal, and you want me to believe he can do it without aid. He'd
have to be the most powerful malkemist ever to live! Ridiculous."
Lorast searched Jack's face as though he might find the trick of it
there, much to Jack's discomfort.

"You can believe it, or you can choose not to. Two men I trust very
much have experienced it first-hand."

"Do we know anything of his blood-line? Any hint of how?" asked
Lorast.

"Jack?" redirected Master Amoth. "Do you know your mother and
father?"

"No."

"There you go, a dead end I'm afraid Lorast. Ultimately though, it
has very little to do with us. I've contacted Grand Master Waisel
and he has given us our marching orders. Jack goes with the
malkemists from Hunter's Vale tomorrow to Pamsley."

Jack's heart skipped a beat hearing that. Of course he had known
something was coming, but not exactly what. He looked at Master
Amoth, but the master was busy skewering green peas with his fork.
Master Greon's face was distorted in a strange way that Jack could
not interpret as an expression. <i>Is he trying to smile?</i> Jack
thought uneasily.

"I wonder if Grand Imaginer Peele would've been so ready to part
with his only son if he thought there was another possibility,"
ventured Lorast.

Master Greon made some guttural muttering that was clearly not
meant to be understood by anyone.

"As promising as this strange ability seems, I hardly think that it
has any bearing on that. Jack is far too old to be taught the art
of malkemy. His ability or abilities, if there are others, will be
limited. As far as we know, he is only able to make one very
specific, and not terribly useful villend," said Master Amoth,
finishing the last of his peas.

"Indeed," said Lorast, his eyebrows raised in a considering steeple.

"Corpa Demic, by all accounts, is extraordinarily powerful,"
continued Master Amoth to the backdrop of one of Master Greon's
disturbing snorts. "More importantly, he has been trained since
young and has the potential to learn even more into the future. The
imaginers as a group seem to think that he fulfils the potential of
some theoretical malkemist their philosopher Treyvik imagined up,
and I personally know little enough of the matter to gainsay them."

"Imaginings on Balance," said Lorast, "That was the book."

"See. I didn't even know that much."

The conversation moved onto questions and answers that Jack did not
understand. He finished his food and then enjoyed the dessert that
Minnie and Emily delivered after clearing the empty trays.
Archivist Melanie entered a challenge tinged discussion with Lorast
about the book he had mentioned earlier. Jack wanted badly to leave
for the kitchen, but there was no gap in the conversation in which
he could ask permission.

Lorast did seem to know quite a lot about the topic of the book and
Archivist Melanie, who had also read the book, was peppering the
man with question after question. Jack barely stiffled a jaw
cracking yawn.

Melanie turned to Jack in surprise. "I'm sorry Jack, you're tired.
Why didn't you excuse yourself?" she asked.

Jack blinked sleepily at her.

"Go, go," she said with a kind smile. "You need your sleep.

"Don't forget to bow," she whispered into his ear.

Jack rose from the table, stepped back, and gave the entire table a
bow as Archivist Melanie had shown him.

"Good night Jack," Master Amoth said into a slight pause in his own
conversation.

Nobody else seemed to pay much attention as he left the room.

In the kitchen, Minnie, Emily, and Alfred were seated at the bench
playing cards.

Minnie looked up as he came in. "Speak of the fox and you'll soon
see his tail," said Minnie with one of her rare smiles.

Jack smiled at the three friendly faces turned in his direction.

"You have a big day ahead of you tomorrow Jack, I'd best put you to
bed," said Emily, and she led him out of the kitchen amid goodnight
wishes from Alfred and Minnie.

Emily saw him into his blue $pyjamas and then tucked him in.

"Master Amoth says you'll be going for a trip to the country, but
that it shouldn't be for too long. We'll see you when you get back
Jack," she said, ruffling his hair.

She left the room with the lantern and Jack was plunged into
darkness.

---

Jack was gently shaken awake before dawn by Master Amoth.

"Time to go Jack," said Master Amoth.

Jack swung out of bed groggily and followed Master Amoth to the
kitchen. Minnie was at her bench folding dough when he came in. She
and Master Amoth exchanged a quick greeting.

"Good morning Jack. You're clothes are there," she said, pointing
with her nose.

"Wait Jack, I need to apply this," Master Amoth said, holding up a
vill. He sprayed Jack in a pattern he had grown very much used to
in the last couple of days.

With that done, Jack changed into his riding clothes and pulled on
his boots.

"Master Amoth, would you be kind enough to tuck those $pyjamas into
Jack's saddlebags by the door?" instructed Minnie. "Wash your face
Jack."

Jack washed his face, and then, to Jack's surprise, Master Amoth
bent and quickly tied Jack's boot for him.

"Take your saddlebags Jack," said Master Amoth, as he headed for the
stable.

"Good luck Jack, and be safe," called Minnie.

Jack waved farewell as he shouldered his saddlebags and rushed to
catch up to Master Amoth.

In the stable, Alfred gave Master Amoth a slight bow, and Jack
noticed that Risle and Taiser—Master Amoth's mount—had already
been saddled. Alfred took Jack's saddlebags, transferred them to
Risle's back, and tied them to her saddle.

Jack took a moment to pet Risle, but Master Amoth seemed determined
to leave immediately.

"Open her up Alfred, thank you," said Master Amoth, donning his
malkemist hat and mounting up.

Before Jack had really thought about it, he was on Risle's back and
leaving the stable.

"Goodbye Jack, we'll see you soon," called Alfred.

"Goodbye Alfred."

The morning air misted in front of Jack's face as horse and mule
broke the relative silence of the pre-dawn with each shod footstep.
Dogs barked and snarled nearby, but for once Jack was not bothered
by it. He felt safe on Risle's back. Not to mention that he had a
malkemist master riding in front of him.

He practised sidestepping and turning Risle for a little while
until she got sick of it and stopped responding. He petted her in
apology and stopped trying.

Meanwhile, they had exited the town proper $towards the river. Jack
was happy because there was no shanty town in this direction. The
Duke kept this side of town clean and beat out anyone who tried to
build in this direction. The city's trade flowed through this
district and the Duke was smart enough to see that it was not
disturbed.

With Master Amoth in the lead no one challenged them as they exited
the town by bridge over the River Paspe. Though it was very early,
there were already farmers and merchants making their way into the
city in the opposite direction. Everyone kept their distance from
Master Amoth.

The roadway gave way to packed earth and Master Amoth lifted his
pace to a trot. Jack was happy to follow suit. His first few paces
were unsteady, but he soon found his groove again from the day
before. The sun was still below the horizon, but the sky was
already brightening with its approach. It allowed Jack see where
they were heading from a long way out. Two malkemists hats were
difficult to miss, even at a distance. Their trot brought them to
the three riders quickly.

The two malkemists offered nods and the boy Demic bowed
respectfully in his saddle as Master Amoth pulled up and greeted
them.

"Good morning Soldier Mond, Soldier Korst. This is the boy that
Grand Master Waisel has requested at Pamsley. We would send him
ourselves, but we can not spare anyone with the appropriate
temperament at the moment. I'm sure you understand."

Both soldiers nodded their understanding, though Soldier Korst did
so somewhat more darkly.

"I have prepared some coin to pay the boy's way," said Master
Amoth, pulling a coin pouch from within his coat.

"That won't be necessary, master," said Soldier Mond. "We agreed to
take him on the strength of Grand Master Waisel's request. Two boys
are not much harder to feed and keep alive than one."

"You're sure?" asked Master Amoth.

"Absolutely. We would be embarrassed to accept it."

"Varley," he said and then turned to Jack. "Corpa Jack, these
soldiers will take you to Pamsley. It's three days ride from here
to the south-east.  Follow their instructions and you will arrive
safely.

"Thank you, soldiers. I leave him in your hands."

Master Amoth turned Taiser around and pulled up next to Jack.

"I don't expect any trouble on the way to Pamsley, but on the off
chance that there is, stay close to Corpa Demic. Those soldiers will
protect him with their lives. Good travelling Jack. We'll see you
again soon."

Jack nodded, but Master Amoth was already moving at a trot $towards
Corsisan. Suddenly he turned back and shouted, "Oh, and don't steal
anything."

Jack had no opportunity to reply, and when he turned back everyone was
trotting away from Corsisan. Jack urged Risle after them and
quickly made up the distance. No one seemed to care that he was
following.

Jack was very quickly farther from Corsisan than he had ever been.
Soldier Korst set the pace, and he would alternatively trot and
then dismount to walk the horses. A couple of clicks at a trot, one
at a brisk walk.

Jack's legs were soon burning with fatigue from the unfamiliar
motion of the ride, and walking was little relief because he was
constantly tripping over his own boots.

Risle began butting him with her large head and it took him some
time to $realise that she was urging him back into the saddle. He
concentrated on lifting his boots clear of the ground instead, and
trudged on until Soldier Korst mounted again.

The walking rest had limbered his riding muscles and Jack began to
pay attention to the country either side of the road, though the
pace was demanding of his concentration. The land around Corsisan
was mostly bare of trees, with fields of mottled green stretching
into the distance. He saw many herds of goats and sometimes cows.
At first he thought it strange that he was not seeing crops of
vegetables or grains, but a trickle of memory reminded him that
Corsisan was supplied with grain from crops close to the river.

The road was dry and hard, but furrowed with the tracks of
countless animals and wheels from the past wet season. Fortunately,
the roadway had been mostly worn flat in the intervening month of
dry weather, making it relatively easy to navigate, even at a fast
trot.

They passed the occasional walker or horse drawn cart, but everyone
stayed well clear and kept their heads down as soon as they grew
aware of the two malkemists in the lead. There were no friendly
waves.

The grass soon gave way to trees, though Jack hardly noticed at
first. His saddle had grown uncomfortable enough to demand most of
his attention. He was not inclined to complain, but even if he
were, he doubted the two terse soldiers would have much patience
for it.

They all rode in silence for the most part, with only the
occassional exchange between the malkemists; one of which was to
pass a midday meal, and another to water the horses.

Jack did not attempt to talk to Demic, and Demic showed no interest
at all in talking to Jack. He felt alone, but worse, he did not
feel safe. Master Amoth had told him to stay close to Demic, but
Jack doubted that that would be a good strategy if there was real
trouble. In fact, it might see him sacrificed to save Demic. A
possibility that Jack was less than enthused by.

The trees opened up again onto grassy fields and they approached a
boy tending a small herd of goats. A large buck placed himself
between the herd and the much larger horses, posturing
aggressively, but the horses and the two mules ignored it
completely. Strangely to Jack, the boy did the exact opposite of
the brave goat. He shank down behind his herd and did not so much
as peek as they passed.

Jack had done similarly himself on the very rare occassions that he
had caught sight of a malkemist on the streets of Corsisan. He was
quite sure that he had not reacted quite so fearfully though, but
then he had not been alone on a deserted road either. <i>Coward.<i>

He turned in his saddle to watch the boy shepherd recede behind
them. When he turned back, Demic was watching him.

"They're always like that. Especially the ones from the farms.
Primities," said Corpa Demic. They were the first words that he had
ever spoken to Jack, and with them said he seemed perfectly content
to return to silence.

Jack had been thinking along similar lines, yet it was still a
shock to hear Demic say the words out loud.

<i>Why?</i> he pondered.

It did not take him long to find an answer. Jack knew his own
thoughts well. They were complex, convoluted. Every thought had a
context. He knew for instance that not every farm hand that came to
the city was a mess of superstition and paranoia. Some were.

Jack could not see any of that nuance in Demic. There was only us
and them. Black and white. Whether that was all he could express,
or if he really thought in such a way, Jack did not know.

By the time they walked into the town of Split Oak—Jack overheard
the name in a snippet of conversation between the two
malkemists—Jack had grown used to the way people treated the
malkemists in their pointy black hats. It was therefore no surprise
when their party stopped at the watering trough in what might be
loosely called the $centre of town, and not a soul was there to
welcome them. The squat wooden buildings that sparsely lined the
way remained silent and thoroughly shuttered, and the only living
attendants were a couple of thin dun $coloured dogs. Even they
seemed to have more sense than to challenge the new arrivals.

"Draw water for the horses," instructed Soldier Korst.

When no one else leaped to the job, Jack $realised that the
instruction had been for him. He emptied the first bucket from the
well into the trough before $realising that there was a bung hole
that needed stoppering. Feeling embarassed for the wasted effort,
he set the bung and tried again.

Soldier Mond took some food from his saddlebags and passed Corpa
Demic his share. To Jack he merely tossed his portion, and
seemingly without the slightest care for whether it arrived safely
or not. Jack did not think much on it. Food was food, and he did
not care even if he had to run and jump for it.

The horses and mules gathered around the trough to drink, and Jack
put aside his food to keep the water up to them. They drank a lot,
but their thirst did not last forever. When they were well watered,
Soldier Mond set a feed bag on the nose of each animal and then
seemed to fill each from a vill. Jack was astonished, but had no
time while he was feeding his own face to go see what was in
Risle's nose bag. He could smell grain though.

He pulled one last pail from the well to wash down his meal and
then went to Risle's head to see what she was eating. She eyeballed
him suspiciously as he slipped his hand into her nose bag, and he
only narrowly avoided a painful nip before pulling his hand free of
the tight confines in triumph.

He had a thick and meaty groat between his thumb and forefinger.

He was no farmer, but he had never seen a seed like it. Slipping it
between his back teeth, he bit down on it tentatively and was
rewarded with a satisfyingly nutty $flavour.

Jack looked $towards the malkemists, his curiosity burning, but the
only person watching him was Demic. In fact, not just watching, he
was weighing Jack with his eyes.

"It's an extinct grain we call Quorth. We create it sterile and use
it as feed during travel."

"Sterile?" asked Jack.

Demic's eyes narrowed as though he had been tricked, and he was
silent for several moments. Jack matched his silence. He may not be
a match for Demic in a lot of things, but when it came to keeping
his mouth shut, Jack was an expert. Still, it came as a surprise
when Demic relented.

"Sterile means the grain won't sprout."

"All of them?" Jack asked.

"They are all the same seed. The same pattern. We do not create
anything that can perpetuate itself. It is strickly forbidden."

"Why?" asked Jack.

Demic's eyes narrowed again, but this time he just looked away and
ignored Jack.

Jack felt a sting of frustration. He had hoped that Demic would be
less tight-lipped than a full malkemist, but it did not seem to be
the case. He had the sense that he was a curiosity to the
malkemists, and that once they understood him, they would answer
only as many of his questions as they thought necessary. That is,
as few as possible.

It suddenly occurred to him that what people feared most about the
malkemists was not the fearful things they were supposed to be
able to do—Jack's imagination chose that exact moment to recall a
gruesome story about melted human bodies—but rather the
impenetrable mystery surrounding the malkemists. Not knowing
exactly what a malkemist could and could not do made them much more
scary.

Jack wandered over to the large oak tree in the middle of theway.
He was almost close enought to touch the bark before he noticed the
large ragged gouge in the tree. The name of the town suddenly made
sense, though the tree seemed to have mostly recovered. He ran his
fingers over the wound, imagining the power that had caused it.

"Lightning," said Soldier Mond from behind Jack, causing him to
jump and turn sharply. "You'll learn about it from the loreaders at
Pamsley, that's what they're good for." His tone said that he did
not think they were good for much else. "Back in your saddle."

The rest of the afternoon was soon lost in a haze of discomfort and
the steady clomp of hooves. Though Jack did have enough of his wits
about him to notice that Risle was handling the day's travel better
than the horses, and even Demic's mule.

The time they four of them spent on their feet, instead of in the
saddle, got longer and longer as the sun approached the horizon,
and it was not Risle holding them back. Jack felt a swell of pride
in her.

They had passed through two more towns, and now the red dusk set
Jack to wondering if they should have stopped in the last one to
find a place to sleep.

Jack crossed a stream on Risle's back, letting her pick her was
across carefully. On the other side he was preparing himself for
another trot when Soldier Korst called a stop.

"We'll camp here."

Jack looked around in confusion at the empty woods. Sparse trees
peppered the landscape in every direction, with bushes and shrubs
hugging the river. There was no sign of a house or a building, not
even a lean-to. Jack looked suspiciously at Soldier Korst,
expecting some kind of twisted and unfunny joke. There was nowhere
to sleep here.

Yet the malkemists unsaddled their mounts and Jack followed suit.
He found a currying brush in his saddlebags and began brushing
Risle's coat clean of sweat and dust.

"I've never nag treated so well," scoffed Soldier Korst. "You can
do my girl once you're finished there."

"And mine," piped in Soldier Mond as he dumped a bundle of kindling
on the ground.

"Tent tonight?" asked Soldier Korst.

Soldier Mond looked at the sky. "No. We should be fine in the
bags."

Moments later a fire roared to life among the kindling. Jack was
surprised, but he was the only one to pay it any mind. Soldier Mond
set about dropping regularly sawn logs onto the energetic
conflaguration.

<i>Where did they come from?</i> thought Jack, figuratively and
literally scratching his head.

In the time it took Jack to rub down one horse the smell of
roasting meat had filled the air. He had no idea how either
malkemist had found time to hunt.

Jack shed his boots as he continied his work and gloried in the
relief of feeling the earth beneath his bare feet yet again.

In contrast, Corpa Demic did very little. He tended his own horse
and then set himself down to read from a thick tome. Within a short
time he seemed completely absorbed in his study.

Jack moved as quietly as he could among the sticks and leaves until
he was able to peer over Demic's shoulder. He was pleased when he
was able to read a few sentences that spoke of ancient history and
something called "energy."

Jack's curiousity got the best of him as he squinted down at the
book in the quickly fading daylight, and he blurted, "Is the whole
book about history?"

"No," Demic answered, his voice cold. "It's rude to read over
someone's shoulder." He shifted on the log he was perched upon, his
crippled hand straining to keep the book from falling. When he had
settled again, Jack was no longer able to see its pages.

Jack sat some distance away on the log instead, pulled out his word
list, and began reciting. He wanted to tweak Demic's nose, but he
held his recital under his breathe. He took pride in how well he
remembered the words that he had been given.

"Baby," muttered Corpa Demic.

Jack felt a surge of shame and then anger, and before he could
think about what he was doing, he hawked and spat in front of
himself in a way so clearly of the shanty, that it made his ears
burn. Demic cast a single look of disgust at him and returned to
his book.

Jack went to the fire to finish his words, his mind searching for a
way to blame Demic for how badly that had gone.

The two soldiers were already cutting meat for themselves and
Soldier Mond pulled a leg free and tossed the piping hot meat to
Jack.

Jack dropped his words to juggle the meat, only just saving it from
falling to the ground. As he took his first bite, Soldier Korst
retrieved the word list with greasy fingers.

He took one look at it and remarked, "You're a bit old to be
learning to read. Are you a retard?"

"No," said Jack, schooling his face to reveal no reaction. "Can you
give me more words?"

"Do I look like your wet nurse? I've got far better things to do."
He crumpled the paper and tossed it at Jack.

Soldier Mond watched Jack from the other side of the fire, but said
nothing.

Corpa Demic chose that moment to walk up to the fire and poach one
of the roasting carcasses for himself. Jack caught a brief flash of
anger on Soldier Korst's face, but it was gone in a moment, and
Demic walked back to his log oblivious.

"I'd help you if I could," said Soldier Mond. "But there's a good
reason I'm a soldier and not an archivist. You could ask your
friend Corpa Demic," Jack wondered if he was imagining the faint
stress on the title. "But I don't fancy your chances over much."

Jack glanced in Demic's direction, but if the cripple had heard the
comment, he gave no indication.

After he had eaten, Jack did not have much to do. He went to the
creek to wash up and then rubbed Risle down again. The moon was not
full, but there was enough moonlight to move around by outside the
circle of firelight. 

He was returning to the warmth of the fire and enjoying the feel of
the rough ground under his bare feet when a suspicious shadow by
the fire made the hair on the back of his neck stand on end.

The shadow raised its head in Jack's direction, as though sensing
his fear, then rose on massive paws and padded over to investigate.

Jack froze for a moment, but quickly recollected himself as the
enormous dog drew closer. He folded his arms tightly over his chest
and stood stock still as his elder brother Stine had taught him.
Jack's fear of dogs had always annoyed Stine to violence; he hated
any form of weakness. For a while he had deliberately dragged Jack
among packs of dogs to toughen him up, but it never worked, and he
had eventually given up.

The animal trotted up with its head high and body wary. The beast's
eyes were level with Jack's chest and Jack felt like he was being
smothered in the animal's presence. He twitched in terror as the
large muzzle nuzzled against Jack's stomach. It was the least
pleasurable of tickles. Each sniff sounded loud to Jack's ears, as
though this dog was trying to breathe him in until there was
nothing left.

At last, and to Jack's great relief, its interest seemed to
subside. Yet, it did not leave. Instead it stood in front of Jack
as though waiting for him to do something. The tension between them
was beginning to build again when a second dog suddenly scurried
out of the darkness, this one smaller than the first, but far more
energetic. It barked loudly and growled, but cut off quickly when
Soldier Korst raised his voice.

"Shut up ya mutt! Heel!"

The new dog reacted with obedient alacrity and returned to Soldier
Korst by the fire. Unfortunately, the larger animal was under no
such compunction and stood fast.

Jack tried to step around it to get to the fire, but to his horror,
the beast blocked his way and slobbered on his vest. He tried not
to panic, but his crossed arms and the brute's massive jaw made him
feel too vulnerable. To control himself he looked away, stood as
still as possible, and tried not to excite those hard bright eyes
any further.

He waited.

The dog waited.

Soldier Mond turned to watch the two of them.

The waiting game continued.

"I think she likes you. I've never seen her take that much interest
in anyone," said Soldier Mond. He did not sound pleased.

"Maybe she's hungry?" suggested Soldier Korst, and they both
snorted in amusement.

"It seems that way, but I don't know if she even knows what hunger
is. She's never been out that long."

Jack puzzled at that cryptic comment, but could not make sense of
it. Though it did serve to distract him from his predicament for a
moment.

Corpa Demic, who was sitting cross-legged on his log and reading by
the light of twin villends glowing at his lapels, looked up briefly
with slitted eyes. The unfolding drama did not seem to interest
him, because he immediately went back to reading his book.

Jack waited, but eventually even he could see that it was not
getting him anywhere, so he slowly, and with great trepidation,
unfolded his arms and placed his hand on her great heavy head. The
fur was surprisingly soft, and when she did not react, he petted
her once, softly.

Gaining courage, he edged his leg in front of her and took a step
toward the fire, his hand still on her head. He took another step.

She raised her head, and for a terrible moment Jack thought that
she was going to bite his hand clean off. Instead, she butted his
side and caused him to stumble. In the end, she followed him all
the way to the fire and Jack stood there feeling idiotic as he
wondered what he should do now.

Before he could think of anything to do, she sat down at his feet.
Jack seized the moment and moved several steps away before he sat
down by himself. His legs groaned as his tired muscles stretched.

Within moments she did exactly what he dreaded she would, she rose
ponderously to her feet and came to him again. Her head towered
over his and her large powerful body looming above his felt to be
easily twice as heavy as his. He was getting ready to spring to his
feet again when she sat down with a thud.

Soldier Mond gave a short bark of laughter, but when Jack looked
up, he was only shaking his head.

Jack rested his hand on her head timidly and began to stroke. He
was deeply wary of her, but while she was sitting still, he saw no
harm in her.

"I've seen her worry a man's head clean off," said Soldier Korst.
"She had him by the back of the neck and flung him around until it
just kind of, popped off." He had a patronising sneer on his face,
so Jack figured he was lying. Now that she was sitting next to him,
she did not seem so fearsome.

On the tail of that thought, she transferred her heavy head onto
his thigh, obviously enjoying the work of his fingers. He wondered
if she would like the currying brush, but he was not willing to go
get up and walk all the way to the saddlebags to find out.

<i>She's not so bad</i>, he thought.

"Oh yeah! That lad at the windmill. The one that threw a pitchfork
at me! Little bastard!" exclaimed Soldier Mond.

"And called you a demon."

Soldier Mond shrugged that one off with a lilted eyebrow. "I'm not
sure which one got him killed."

Now, Jack believed them. Strangely though, his fear was subsiding.

He eventually fell asleep beside her.

---

Jack woke to a loud scream. A cry of terror and pain.

The shock of it sent spikes of pain through his own body as it
capapulted him to wakefulness. Men were roaring and cursing and
calling out all around, just beyond the dim glow of the burnt out
campfire.

The scream cut off with a gurgle, just as Jack made out a confusing
flurry of movement in that direction. A man leapt the fire and
landed close by Jack with a mighty cry, the axe in his hand
sweeping at something above Jack's head.

Jack was immediately engulfed in a pile of heavy fur, and from the
confusion of his sleep and fear addled brain, he $realised that she
had been standing astride him defensively. He felt muscles bunch an
instant before she sprung from him like a blanket pulled quickly
away. The man's posturing cry turned to a despair filled wail. Jack
knew that sound, he had heard it many times in the shanty, and once
in a while among the mud palaces. It was the sound a man made when
he feels the end.  Death, whether in the next moment, or next week,
approaches inexorably.

The sound was accompanied by a tremendous spray of warm blood as
the she-dog tore a chunk of flesh from the man's inner thigh and
groin. The axe he had been drawing back, ready to deliver a second
swing, flew unattended from his grasp.

Just then a blinding light erupted a dozen paces from the fire,
causing Jack to squeeze his eyes shut in pain. A general outcry of
dismay rose around the campfire.

"Kill the malkemists! Kill them first!" screamed one brave soul
into the relative hush.

Those words were met by a scream of rage, and Jack forced his eyes
open a crack to see the source. Through pain-teared eyes he thought
he could see one of the malkemists. He blinked against the tears
and the blinding light to bring the figure into focus.

Something was wrong. It was too big to be either of the malkemists.

Suddenly, a heavy spear was thrust into the chest of the figure,
but it brushed the weapon aside with a single swung of a heavy arm,
as effective as a cudgel, and then pounced upon the wielder. It
took a broad swipe at the attacker and the man's arm was excised.
<i>Are those claws?</i> Jack wondered in terrified awe.

The roar of rage continued and other men fell, but Jack could see
no end to the human tide from his vantage on the ground.

Someone screamed in agony nearby Jack, and he turned to see a man
stumbling backwards, both hands scratching and clawing at his face.
Corpa Demic stood there, encased in the clear gel of the
malkemists, his face immobile and cold. There was no pity or mercy
there.

"Kill him!"

Jack followed the sound of that screamed command and met the eyes
of another malkemist. His body was also enveloped in a protective
gel similar to Corpa Demic's, and he looked mad with either anger
or fear.

"Kill him now!"

Jack was not the only one to take notice of this new malkemist. The
clawed figure leapt forward towards the intruder, unmanning the
meager men who stood in its way. Some actually dived away to avoid
the terrible claws and impenetrable skin.

"Cowards! Whoresons! Get him! He..."

He got no further as a clawed mitt threatened to decapitate him. A
heavy arrow thudded into the back of the figure, but it seemed to
have no effect, and the assault was ignored.

The new malkemist raised a sword to defend himself, but the effort
seemed futile in the face of an enemy that seemed impervious to
assault and was dealing out savage slashes in a tattoo of
relentless power.

The gel skin of the malkemist was protecting him, but Jack noticed
that small wedges of the stuff were being hacked away at each
stroke.

Suddenly, a man flew bodily over Jack's head and landed in the
glowing coals of the fire, sending sparks and flames shooting up
into the night air. The unfortunate man began to scream, his cries
mixing with the terrified sobbing of Corpa Demic's victim, who was
now on his knees on the ground clawing up dirt in a frantic effort
to salve his ravaged face.

Jack spun around to see Risle gambolling around with her large ears
laid flat. She reared before a man with a spear and her striking
fore hooves forced him to dive aside.

The she-dog pounced with surprising speed on the tumbling man,
taking his forearm in her powerful jaws and threatening to tear the
arm from its socket. He tried to stab her with his spear, but she
was too close. He frantically shortened his grip on his spear to
draw back and run her through, but Risle ended the effort by
slamming her metal shod hooves down on the man's legs. Jack heard a
distinct crack above the general cacaphony. He expected a scream,
but none came. The man was unconscious, yet Risle continued to
trample him.

Jack got to his knees and looked $towards the dueling malkemists.
The clawed figure had circled around to one side of the malkemist,
which Jack understood to mean that it took the armed men it had
left at its back at least a little seriously. The relentless
slashing of the claws had worked to thin the other malkemist's
protective gel, and as the half dozen men moved to flank the
figure, it finally drove a clawed mitt home.

The malkemist went still and groaned loudly, causing the other men
to stop dead in their tracks. The moment of stillness should have
been a moment of silence, but the burning man, the man with the
acid-burned face, and several others clutching at various wounds
and amputated limbs made that an impossibility.

The figure knocked the sword from the malkemist's grip, gathered
itself, then lifted the malkemist into the air by his impaled
belly with a roar.

Still the surrounding men did not move.

The malkemist slammed into the ground with a thud and was
dispatched by a decisive stab to the chest.

The half dozen men standing between Jack and the figure began
dropping their weapons. Some fell to their knees or bowed their
heads in submission.

Jack got to his feet and the large she-dog immediately pressed
herself against his side. Jack rested his hand on her shoulders
without a second thought, even when he noticed the blood around her
muzzle and the spatters on her head.

"Why? Why are you here?" yelled the figure. Jack $recognised
Soldier Korst's angry voice, but the bright light behind the man
cast his face and body in shadow.

"Answer me!" he roared, striding to the nearest kneeling man.
"Answer!"

The kneeling man sobbed something, but it either made no sense to
Soldier Korst, or he was not satisfied by it. He dug his claws into
the man's shoulder, eliciting a cry of pain.

"The boy!" cried the man. "The boy!"

"Who the fuck gives a fuck about a pampered rich shit?"

The kneeling man tried to say something more, but Soldier Korst
struck him, the contact making a wet sound, and he crumpled to the
ground.

The other men immediately scrambled to flee, each moving away from
Soldier Korst as quickly as they could. Two particular men made the
mistake of running together and Soldier Korst pursued them first,
cutting them down within heartbeats. Without pause he sprinted
after the next nearest man.

One man stumbled as he passed Jack, doing his best to avoid the
massive she-dog, and ran directly into the path of Corpa Demic. A
puff of fire engulfed him and he fell with a cry of surprise. The
surprise soon turned to pain as he writhed on the ground.

Jack was $paralysed. The danger was quickly fleeing, yet he could
not think what to do. Men were crying all around him. Some sobbing,
others whining, and another screaming and rolling around like a
madman. The lucky ones seemed to be dead or unconscious. Jack
looked at Corpa Demic for a hint of what he should be doing, but he
had not moved, nor had his expression changed. He stared out at the
scene of human devastation as though it was a completely normal
thing. Perhaps even a desirable thing.

A flicker of irritation marred Corpa Demic's smooth, cold features
and his eyes fixed on the screaming man. As he stared, his frown
deepened. Then, as quickly as it had appeared, the frown was gone
and he was moving.

Jack watched on with confusion as the crippled boy picked up an
axe. The same axe that one of the men had tried to kill the she-dog
with. That recollection made Jack look for that man and Jack's eyes
found him quickly.

He was not one of the crying men. He was very clearly dead.

Corpa Demic dragged the axe back in his good hand. All the way back
to the screaming man. Flames were still wicking unabatedly on his
clothes and skin. Jack could not see Demic's face as the boy used
his crippled hand to help lift the heavy double-bladed axe
awkwardly above his head. He brought the weapon down convulsively
and hit the screaming man in the head.

With the flat of the blade.

The screaming changed tone and Corpa Demic cursed.

"Here," he growled. "You do it!" He held out the axe handle for
Jack to take.

"What?"

"Kill him."

"I can't do that."

"You have to. His screams annoy me."

On those words, the screaming stopped, and they turned to look at
the burning man together. Though the screaming had stopped, the
flames had not, and the smell of burning flesh was intensifying.

"He'll wake up again, and he'll scream," Corpa Demic said after a
long pause. They stared at each other. A hoarse scream sounded in
the distance.

"He will die anyway," continued Corpa Demic. "They will all die.
They are koyim who attacked malkemists. They are koyim who killed
a malkemist." He gestured vaguely to the other side of the fire,
and Jack's eyes followed.

He saw Soldier Mond's body for the first time, a spear still lodged
in his chest.

"Korst will kill them all eventually. He can't let them live."
There was a note of pleading in his voice now.

Jack took the axe from Demic grimly. Unlike Demic's soft hands, his
had held an axe before. He knew how to use it. A wood splitter was
an axe afterall. He set his feet purposefully, $visualising where
he would strike.

He swung the axe up in a smooth arc, his left hand sliding up and
along the haft, and then brought it down in a rush.

The axe burried itself in the loamy soil. It surprised him when the
man's head rolled free of his body. Demic's eyes were wide when
they met Jack's.

The sobbing man with the acid burned face did not look up as Jack
took his head. Jack could not help but think of Master Greon. They
continued to move from man to man. Mercifully, many were already
dead or unconscious. One man was dragging himself slowly toward
safety over the leaves and broken twigs, his legs a dead weight
behind him. Demic barred his path, spear in hand.

"Let me go young master," he begged.

He was promising to never tell a soul when his head rolled free.

They found Soldier Korst's dog lying on its side and breathing
raggardly. A wound through its chest was surrounded by a foam of
bloody bubbles. Jack set himself to put it out of its misery.

"No! Don't do that," said Demic with an anxious note in his voice.

"Huh? I thought malkemists didn't follow the Cayophant."

"Not that idiot. We created the Cayophant. Korst will handle his
mimeo when he returns. He won't be happy if you destroy it."

Jack was relieved enough to be free of the task.

There was a sound behind them and they both spun to face it.
Soldier Korst came stumbling out of the forest, his face ashen and
haggard. He had shrunk to his normal proportions and his white
linen shirt was soaked in blood.

"Water," he ordered in a coarse voice.

Jack dropped the axe and ran to ran to collect a waterskin. He
brought it to where Soldier Korst was staring down at Soldier
Mond's body. The soldier took the waterskin without a word and
drank deeply.

"He was stronger than me," he said aloud but to himself. He frowned
and looked at the she-dog. "Where were you bitch?" he demanded,
kicking loose dirt and twigs in her direction.

She lifted her head, but otherwise ignored the gesture. He stared
at her malevolently.

"You were always troublesome. I warned him to destroy you many
times. That was his mistake." Gritting his teeth, he stalked
unsteadily to the discarded axe and picked it up.

Jack could see what he was about by the glint in his eye. So too,
evidently, could the she-dog. She rose to her full height, hackles
raised and teeth bared in a feral display.

The sight of her gave Soldier Korst pause, but his anger overrode
his caution and his wounds as he advanced on her.

"No!" Jack yelled, placing himself between the two, his back to the
snarling canine.

"Fuck off out of the way."

Jack wanted to get out of the way, but his legs stupidly refused to
yield. All he knew was that he needed to protect her, even though
he doubted he could. Soldier Korst drew back the flat of the axe,
ready to batter Jack's skull.

"We need her," broke in Demic unexpectedly.

"She shouldn't even be alive. She needs to be put down now."

"If we're attacked again, we'll need her."

"I decide what we need," replied Soldier Korst truculently, but he
had already turned his back and buried the head of the axe in the
ground.

Jack watched him walk away warily, but it was no trick. The man's
mercurial temper was disconcerting.

He went to his own dog and knelt beside it. Jack was surprised to
see him stroke the animal's head tenderly. For a moment, Jack could
not believe what he was seeing, the dog grew translucent before his
eyes, then transparent.  That which remained quickly gathered and
coagulated in the air, then rushed into the waiting villend in
Soldier Korst's hand. The dog had completely disappeared.


Soldier Korst got up and seemed to take in the extent of the
decapitated bodies.

"Who did this?"

"He did," said Demic, pointing at Jack.

"Impressive retard. Remind me to sleep with one eye open from now
on." He walked to his saddlebags, his body bent over in pain and
his steps unsteady. "I've got some patching to do, you two
backtrack down the road and bring back their horses. They're staked
out at three hundred paces or so. Go." His voice was pained and
even shorter on patience than usual.

Jack was more than happy to leave the camp and headed immediately
for the creek. The she-dog followed closely on his heels. Demic
hesitated, but he followed soon enough.

Jack trudged barefoot through the creek without missing a beat. His
legs were stiffer than they had been, even immediately after the
ride, but the last thing he wanted to do right now was climb back
into a saddle. In contrast, Demic cursed as he walked through the
creek. Jack imagined that his stockings were become thoroughly
waterlogged.

"I shouldn't be taking orders from a soldier," Demic grumbled. He
had fashioned a torch from one of his lighting villends and a tube
of leather. Jack found it annoying. Demic never seemed to be
pointing it in the right direction, and if Jack tried to look
anywhere else, his night eyes were so badly ruined that he may as
well have been blind. He felt the strong urge to rip it from the
other boy's grasp and either throw it away or use it himself.

They found the horses quickly, yet Jack was surprised to find that
there were only four of them, since there had been far more men
than that. He said so out loud.

"You thought they could all afford a horse?" asked Demic in an
uncharitable tone. "Be careful with that fancy one," he said,
pointing.

"Why?"

"That's the malkemist's horse obviously. Sometimes they're trained
to hurt people."

"You're a malkemist, you handle it then."

"Good one. Malkemists are people too."

Jack snorted and turned his back on Demic. He approached the large
black horse carefully. Demic unhelpfully shone the torch in his
direction, which was the last thing he wanted or needed. He edged
closer. The light glinting off the beast's eye gave it a wild cast,
and Jack was not sure that touching it would be a good idea at all.

Suddenly, Demic gave a cry and then light flashed away, leaving
Jack in darkness. Demic's carelessness made Jack angry. He turned
to curse him out, but Demic was lying facedown on the ground, an
arrow sticking out from his back.

Jack dropped down into a crouch. This time, he heard the thrum of a
bowstring, and then a rattle behind him as the arrow skittered
across the ground behind him. The archer cursed in the darkness,
but Jack could not see well enough to make him out. She she-dog
growled and shot from his side. Jack ran after her as quickly as he
could. The archer could see him in the dark, but Jack could not see
the archer.

He grabbed up the torch that Demic had dropped and turned it on the
archer, catching the man mid-draw. The archer cursed again, caught
between shooting the dog or the light in Jack's hand.

He never got to choose before the she-dog bowled into him. Jack ran
up with the torch, intending to blind the man, but it was not
necessary. The she-dog had bitten down on the man's face and was
shaking him about $vigourously. Jack heard his neck snap with a
crack.

Wasting no time, he ran back to Demic. To his relief, the boy was
still breathing. He rolled him onto his side, careful not to touch
the arrow that had passed from back to front.

Demic's eyes fluttered open with a groan.

"What?"

"You were shot. There's an arrow in you."

"Shit!"

"Can't you heal it?"

"I'm not a malkemist Jack," he said, pausing for a pained breath.
"I'm not even supposed to make villends, let alone use them." He
closed his eyes for a moment, his breath coming in small gasps.

"I. Need. Korst."

Jack slowly released him, making sure that he did not roll back
over onto the arrow. Then he ran.

He sprinted into the camp short of breath, noticing two things at
once. The decapitated heads were now neatly lined up on the log,
their eyes turned away from the camp, and Soldier Korst lay by the
fire and amid several dead bodies. He was evidently trying to
sleep, but he cracked an eye as Jack rushed up.

"What?" he challenged.

"Demic's been shot!" Jack blurted.

Both of the soldier's eyes flew open, bleary yet alert. Alarm was
building on his face, perhaps even panic. Jack did not wait to see.
He was already running back the way he had come. Soldier Korst
overtook him only a dozen paces from the torch that picked Demic
out in the dark.

He stopped short of the wounded boy in dismay, both hands clenched
in his hair.

"Fuck. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit."

Demic lay as still as death, the shaft of the arrow gruesomely
large in comparison to his frail chest.

"Is he dead?" Soldier Korst asked softly.

Jack did not think the question was for him, so he kept his mouth
shut. Demic's eyes fluttered open and stared at Soldier Korst. The
expression on the man's face was not encouraging.

"Give it to me straight doc," said Demic in a pained whisper. It
was the first time Jack had heard him say anything even remotely
funny. His sense of $humour was obviously quite dark.

"I think you should be dead," said Soldier Korst in a flat, numb
voice. "That arrow looks like it goes straight through your heart."

Demic did not answer, and Soldier Korst shook himself into action.
He pulled two small, pretty rods from his vest, each transparent
and no wider than his palm. He then took out a villend and seemed
to pretend to wind a thread from it around one rod and then the
other. Seeing nothing, Jack thought he was playing until he gripped
each rod in either hand and pulled them apart to a sudden stop. The
rods were connected by a very thin and very strong string of some
kind. Whatever held them together was invisible.

The soldier knelt by Demic's chest and passed the rod's either side
of the arrow, close to Demic's shirt. To Jack's surprise, the
length of arrow sticking out of Demic's chest fell off cleanly.

Demic groaned in pain.

Soldier Korst put the villend to one of the rods, waited a moment,
and then packed all three away in his vest. He then tore great
rents in Demic's shirt, front and back.

"I don't have enough of my healing villend left to heal you, but it
might be enough to keep you alive."

Demic said nothing, just stared into the soldier's face. Each
breath was obviously causing him pain.

"I need you to pull the arrow out Jack. Get behind him and put your
feet either side of it. Pull it out quickly. Don't try to be
gentle. Then get the fuck out of the way. You clear?"

Jack nodded and took up his position as instructed. Demic groaned
again as Jack gripped the shaft. He looked Soldier Korst in the
eye.

"When you're ready," mocked Soldier Korst, saluting him with a
silver vill in his hand as though offering a toast, his bravado a
thin veneer over his fear.

Jack imagined Demic's pain, and the pain that was about to be
visited upon him. He wondered if it would not be kinder to let him
die. Yet, Soldier Korst, who had faced down a dozen armed men and
another malkemist without a hint of fear, was terrified of Demic's
death. He would not be letting Demic go to any kind of rest if he
could help it.

Jack pulled the arrow.

For a terrible moment he thought the shaft was struck fast beyond
the ability of his muscles to pull out, but at the last moment it
sprung free. He was not sure if he heard or he felt the shaft grind
against bone, but of course it was both. The vibration of it in his
hands made them tickle unpleasantly, and the sound in his ears set
his teeth on edge.

Demic gave a short cry and then fell silent.

Jack rolled away and onto his feet with the bloody arrow in his
hand to watch Soldier Korst work.

Demic's unsupported body rolled over onto its back, his head
lolling lifelessly.

Soldier Korst lined up the welling wound with the silver vill and
released three clear drops. Everything he had left.

"That's it?" Jack asked.

"Shut yer face."

Soldier Korst's face was strained, and Jack found himself watching
the wound just as intently as the soldier. Nothing seemed to be
happening. They waited for what seemed a very long time to Jack,
but was perhaps only several hundred heart beats.

The grim soldier took a flap of Demic's rent shirt and dabbed the
blood over the wound. Jack's eyebrows rose when he saw whole flesh
beneath. Red and enflamed flesh, but whole.

"You healed him," Jack breathed in awe, but the soldier shook his
head.

"No. I don't think so. There wasn't enough."

He rolled Demic away and onto his side to inspect the wound. Jack
had to get up and step over Demic to see for himself.

The rear wound was unchanged. Under the leaf litter the soldier
brushed aside, it still bled. He sat there staring pensively at the
wound for some time, before suddenly standing and going to the dead
malkemist's horse. Jack noticed wryly that the animal was as quiet
as a mouse as the soldier rifled through its saddlebags to withdraw
a beautifully clean white linen shirt.

He tore strips from the shirt as he returned.

"We need to clean the wound so it doesn't get infected. Hold this."
He passed Jack the now tattered shirt.

From the seemingly inexhaustable supply of vills tucked away in his
vest he withdrew another and poured an incongruous amount of liquid
from it over the wound, and then soaked the strip of linen in his
hand.

Jack could smell alcohol, and he winced on Demic's behalf as the
soldier roughly wiped the wound clean. He took another strip from
Jack, folded and then soaked it, before pressing it against the
bloody hole.

"Hold that."

Jack held the cold wet fabric in place gingerly, watching in
fascination as individual spots of red bloomed on the surface.

Meanwhile, Soldier Korst fashioned a sticky patch from a square
patch of linen and a different vill entirely. Waving Jack away, he
set it over the wound, and then rocked back on his heels and took a
deep breath, his expression worried.

"I'm far better at putting holes in people than patching them up,
even when I have plenty of my healing villend. I just hope it was
enough to heal the lung. If not, we'll be dragging a corpse around
before too long." He pressed his thumbs tightly against his brow
ridge. "If that happens, you're on your own, cause I'll be riding
west."

"It wasn't your fault," said Jack.

The soldier snorted without amusement.

"Have you ever heard the expression, there's no $honour among
theives?"

Jack nodded, though truthfully he had never heard it before.

"Well, among malkemists, forgiveness is even rarer. I'd sooner rely
on the kindness of a pack of wild dogs."

Soldier Korst created a crude litter and fastened it to the dead
malkemists horse—an exceptionally docile animal—and it dragged
Demic back to camp. Jack expected the soldier to go back to sleep,
but instead he began saddling his horse. Without a word, Jack
followed suit, first saddling saddling Risle and then Demic's mule.

The soldier saddled Soldier Mond's horse as well, and Jack expected
him to throw the corpse over the saddle, but instead he began
stripping the body. It was the first time that Jack had seen the
inner vest that the malkemists used to carry vills around with. He
was fascinated to see row after row of small pouches, each with a
vill poking out.

"Maybe Soldier Mond had a healing villend," suggested Jack. Soldier
Korst turned eyes on him that spoke volumes of his serious
reservations about Jack's intelligence.

"He had many. Of different types to boot. Yet, completely useless
to me, or almost any other malkemist for that matter. If we make it
as far as Pamsley, I'll nad them over to a master. They might have
someone who can sense some of them well enough to make use of. Same
with his," he pointed $towards the other dead malkemist.

He stripped both malkemist corpses naked and then applied a villend
to each which encased the flesh in the clear protective gel that
Jack had been seeing regularly. Instead of covering the tops of the
corpses though, they opened up like shallow tubs. They looked like
transparent coffins, Jack had seen quite a few of those. The
soldier stood over Soldier Mond's body as though he wanted to say
something, but ultimately, he did not. Instead, he opened a new
villend and upended a torrent of liquid into the tub. Jack was as
amazed as ever to see so much come from such a small bottle. He
noticed that the soldier was very, very careful not to splash the
liquid out of the tub. Soldier Mond's body began to bubble and
fizz. Soldier Korst did the same to the other malkemist, then
turned his back on the both of them and walked away.

Jack stood there watching the bodies bubble. He could not see well
by the light of the malkemist lamp, but it seemed that the bodies
had began to darken. A few moments later he rushed back to help
Soldier Korst, who had began tying the four extra horses and
Demic's mule into a train.

As they mounted up, Jack could not contain himself any longer.
"Aren't we going to take Soldier Mond?"

The soldier did not even look around to answer. "There is no
Soldier Mond. By sunrise, he'll be a greasy black stain on the
ground."

Soldier Korst passed the reins of the train lead, Demic's mule, to
Jack. He felt a moment of panic. <i>I can't handle five of them by
myself!</i> He opened his mouth to protest, but Soldier Korst was
already moving off, leading the dead malkemist's horse and Demic's
shallowly breathing body down the road. Jack was forced to take a
deep breath and signal Risle forward. He was pleasantly surprised
when the train settled into a neat and orderly line. He looked back
at the mess they were leaving behind, but the only thing that met
his eyes were the seven severed heads perched on the log. He
imagined their vacant stares following him as he rode away, but of
course he could not see their eyes, open or closed, by the dim
moonlight.

***

Demic woke after sunrise and demanded water. Soldier Korst
obviously expected Jack to attend to the corpa, but since Jack had
four horses and a mule on lead, he was forced to do it himself.
Jack was diplomatic enough to avoid eye contact while the soldier
served the young corpa water.

Demic drank a lot, despite each swallow causing him pain.

"I can put you to sleep. You want that?" asked Soldier Korst.

Demic shook his head and subsided back into his litter. Soldier
Korst had been clever enough to construct the litter in such a way
that as few of the knocks and bumps from the road jolted Demic as
possible. However, within only a short time, Demic was croaking for
the soldier's attention.

He scarfed down the proferred sleeping draught with little of his
usual reserve.

After the boy fell asleep, Soldier Korst reached beneath the
litter. He withdrew his hand and Jack saw wet blood on his
fingertips. The soldier shook his head as he adjusted the boy's
blanket, surreptitiously wiping the blood on the dark wool.

Jack frowned in disapproval, wondering what Minnie would do to
someone she caught doing that.

They kept the horses moving at a walk, since the litter allowed
nothing else. Jack would have preferred to walk on his own two
feet, since he was still barefooted, yet he followed Soldier
Korst's lead instead. Meanwhile, his boots sat over Risle's rump,
jostling about uselessly. Soldier Korst did not seem to care if he
wore them or not.

Demic's breathing became more and more strained as the morning wore
on, and the soldier would look back anxiously at Demic on the more
pronounced rattles and wheezes. Jack wanted to ask why they were
continuing onward $towards Pamsley, when Corsisan was obviously
much closer, but he did not dare given the faces the soldier was
pulling. The man checked in on Demic every click or so, and in
between he stood in his stirrups, straining forward, as though he
could eat up the road faster that way.

Still they progressed at a walk.

At midday, they entered a small town and approached the central
well.

"Draw water."

Jack jumped down immediately and began pulling water for the
horses. He watched from the corner of his eye as the irritable
Soldier Korst woke Demic.

Demic made soft mewling noises as he was roused. The soldier fed
the boy water slowly and patiently, like a sinner performing a
penitence. He seemed changed for the better as he tended Demic.
Jack was not fooled.

He continued to haul water for the animals. He was almost finished
when Soldier Korst's boot caught him squarely and painfully in the
butt, threatening to pitch him headlong into the well.

"Put your boots on," he growled.

Jack scuttled back to Risle to fetch his boots, and began the slow
and laborious process of putting them on. While he was still lacing
up the second boot, a man approached the well. Jack tensed, his
heart flip-flopping painfully in his chest.

"Korst," the man greeted, his voice neither friendly nor hostile.

"Holt," Soldier Korst replied with the exact same tone.

"You going to see the old man?"

"Yes I am," replied the soldier a little pointedly. The question
seemed to bear more weight than was apparent.

"I see." He seemed surprised.

"Can I borrow your cart?" Soldier Korst asked.

The man named Holt craned his neck to get a good look at Demic
before replying.

"You gonna bring it back?"

"No."

Holt stared a long moment at the malkemist, and eventually the
soldier elaborated.

"I'll leave it with the old man. I don't have time to be returning
anything."

Holt shrugged and walked away.

"Throw in some straw!" Soldier Korst called out to Holt's
retreating back. There was no response.

Holt returned some time later with an elderly looking horse
harnessed to a cart.

"She's still alive?" asked the soldier with a note of surprise.

"Yes. And she'd better not die in your care. The kids love her."

Soldier Korst rocked his head from side-to-side ambivalently, as
though to say, whatever will be, will be.

"You can take these three. The others might get you in trouble."
Soldier Korst pointed out the three horses from the clearing that
had not belonged to a malkemist. "And give me a hand with the boy."

The soldier unhitched the makeshift litter and the two men carried
it and the boy up onto the bed of thresh. Demic did not make a
sound beyond his ragged breathing and Jack wondered if he had been
put to sleep again, or was merely unconscious.

"I don't know much and much at all, but that one looks almost
done," commente Holt.

"For my sake, I hope you're wrong."

"He's pale as death," mused Holt. He pulled back the blanket and
whistled when he saw the blood soaked shirt. "There's why, not
enough blood in him to pink his lips."

The malkemist flicked the blanket back into place pointedly.

"Grab yer horse, we're leaving retard. You get those boots on yet?"

Jack had just finished and was already tripping over them to untie
the three horses the malkemist had offered to Holt. It did not help
that the she-dog had chosen that moment to be close to Jack and was
stopping him from walking a straight line.

"That's a big dog," said Holt. "Can it keep up with the horses?"

"I don't know. It's never had to try before," replied the malkemist
as he tied the reins of his horse to the cart and then jumped into
the hotseat.

He was some way down the road before Jack had gathered the other
mounts and mounted up himself.

***

It was mid-afternoon when Jack $realised that he could not hear
Demic breathing anymore. He strained his ear for a moment, thinking
that it might be a trick of falling hooves that had masked the
sound. It was not.

"Soldier Korst! Korst!"

"What?" the malkemist queried in a grumpy voice, his attention on
the road.

"He's stopped breathing!"

Soldier Korst looked him in the eye for a bare moment, as though he
were deciphering what Jack had just said. Suddenly, comprehenion
dawned, and he launched himself into the back of the cart. He
pressed his hand against Demic's throat, his body dead still except
for the movement of the cart.

A moment later he subsided back against the side of the cart in
relief.

"You scared me. He's still alive, but probably not for long. We're
close though."

He jumped back to the front of the cart and pushed the nag for a
little more speed. The cart looked ready to rattle apart from the
added strain, but the malkemist did not seem to care anymore.

When the cart turned off the road, Jacj almost missed it. He had
not seen the small track leading away from the road until the cart
was turning onto it. Strangely, the track proved smoother than the
road, and the cart was given some relief. Soldier Korst kept
glancing back at the unconscious boy, but even Jack could see that
there was nothing he could tell about Demic's condition from where
he sat.

The trees around the track gave way to a field, and nearby, a
wooden house with a veranda. The veranda seemed to extend all the
way around. Two dogs suddenly shot from beneath the wooden floor of
the veranda, barking ferociously.

The she-dog rushed to meet the two, the difference between their
sizes becoming more and more apparent as the gap was closed. She
loomed gigantically over the two smaller dogs. They stopped clear
of her, hackles raised and teeth bared.

Their ferocity scared Jack, but the she-dog was not impressed in
the least. She did not stop. She did not pause. She crashed into
the first dog and scuttled the smaller creature, her massive jaws
closing on fur and flesh. The small dog tumbled in a mess, and its
ferocious growl transformed into piercing yips of pain and alarm.
When it got its feet under it, it did not challenge the she-dog
again. Instead, tail firmly tucked between its legs, it sprinted
back $towards the house just as fast as it had come out. It did not
stop yipping all the while.

A clear, high pitched whistle issued from the house as the she-dog
turned on the second dog. However, either the second dog had
learned fear, or it responded to the whistle, because it headed
back to the house on the tail of the first dog.

The she-dog turned a circle, checking her back, but only took her
sharp eyes from the retreating pair for a bare moment.

A broad chested man leaned against a veranda post as the cart
pulled up.

"Korst." It was almost exactly the same tone that Holt had used
back in the town, neither friendly nor hostile.

"Quick Old Man, please! The boy needs help!" The malkemis gestured
urgently to Demic's prone form in the cart.

"You can heal. Do it yourself."

"I've used mine up. Please help, he's dying."

"I don't see how that's any of my business," he groused.
Nevertheless, he climbed into the cart and took Demic's wrist.
After only a moment, he declared, "This boy is dead. Even I can't
bring them back from there. You'll recall it's forbidden."

"No! He's not dead! I just checked him!"

"Don't shout at me boy! I think I can tell the difference."

Soldier Korst jumped into the back of the cart and put his hand to
the boy's still neck.

Jack waited with baited breath. The malkemist's face became more
and more bleak with each passing moment, until he finally let go
with a sigh. His shoulders slumped.

"Fuck!"

The other man looked on with bemused goodwill and commiseration.
His face said that he would like to help, but that there was just
no way.

Jack felt a pang for Demic. He had not been very pleasant company,
but Jack thought that he might have been warming up to him. He
watched Soldier Korst closely, expecting an explosion.

The Old Man's face suddenly brightened. "Wait! Did you put him to
sleep?"

"Huh?"

"The boy. Did you put him to sleep?"

"Yeah, what of it."

"Try waking him."

"He's dead. You can't wake a corpse!" Soldier Korst's voice was
tinged with annoyance and anger.

"While that is true, he may not be a corpse just yet. Try it!"

Soldier Korst took a deep breath before taking out a vill and
holding it against Demic's pale flesh. He held it there for a few
moments before pulling it away.

Nothing happened. The soldier shrugged, as though that was exactly
what he had expected to happen. The other man was a little more
optimistic. He took Demic's hand and shook it.

Nothing.

"Oh well, it was worth a try. Sometimes particular sleeping
villends can cause the heart to slow almost to a stop."

Soldier Korst drew back his fist, teeth clenched, as though to beat
the corpse.

"His eyes moved," Jack blurted as he saw it. The soldier looked and
then gave Jack a doubtful look.

Demic's eyes fluttered open.

"Quick! Quick! Heal him!" screamed Soldier Korst, suddenly
$energised again. He was practically bouncing with excitement.

"I warned you boy. Don't yell at me."

Jack was very confused by the soldier calling this person "Old
Man," and the "Old Man" responding with "boy." He looked no older
than Soldier Korst.

The blanket was pulled aside and they rolled Demic over onto his
stomach. His linen shirt was stuck to the litter, but they yanked
the two apart unceremoniously. Soldier Korst tore the patch from
the wound.

"Arrow?" asked the Old Man.

Soldier Korst nodded tersely.

"Did it come out?"

"It went straight through."

"Little wonder, there isn't much to him."

"Should I clean it?" the soldier asked.

"No, it'll only interfere with my villend."

The wound was angular and an angry red. The flesh immediately
around it was also reddened, in contrast to Demic's otherwise
clean and pale flesh.

The Old Man applied a villend without ceremony. One, two drops.
Three, four. A fifth.

"Is it enough?" Soldier Korst asked anxiously.

"It's enough," bit off the Old Man, his tone clearly offended.

Demic took a deep breath and groaned in pain. The groan became a
sob and then a cry. He was obviously in agony, but neither of the
malkemists seemed particularly concerned now. Soldier Korst's face
was awash with relief and pleasure, while the other man looked on
with the reserved pleasure of an artisan pleased with the results
of his work.

"Clean him up at the trough Korst. And get some water into him,"
the Old Man ordered. He was already heading back into the house.

Demic continued to sob and groan.

"You heard him boy," said Soldier Korst to Jack, before promptly
following the other man into the house.

Jack watched him disappear into the house. He supposed the Old Man
was a malkemist, though he did not dress like a malkemist. It made
him wonder how many people he had walked past without knowing that
they were a malkemist.

The she-dog was pacing the front of the veranda and occassionally
sniffing her surroundings, as Jack had often observed dogs to do.
Demic was still on his side in the cart, breathing more deeply, but
raggardly. There were tears of pain in his eyes when Jack offered
him water.

He was thirsty, but refused to sit up. Instead, Jack poured a
little water into Demic's mouth, waited for him to swallow, then
repeated until Demic waved him off.

"I have to clean you," Jack explained, wondering how he was going
to carry Demic to the trough.

Demic shook his head in near panic, his eyes pleading with Jack not
to touch him.

"It hurts," he managed to croak.

"But they healed you. You should be better."

"Not yet. One. More. Thing."

"Varley," Jack reassured, hoping that Demic would not exert himself
any further. Now he had a problem. He could not take Demic to the
trough in pain like this, but he still needed to wash him.

He decided to bring pail over and wash him on the cart. He fetched
the dead malkemist's tattered shirt from his saddlebags and ripped
some more rags from it. With the pail of water and rags perched on
the cart, he went and got a large knife from Soldier Korst's saddle
sheath.

Jack cut what remained of Demic's shirt from him with the knife,
which turned out to be scarily sharp, and began soaking a rag in
the pail of water. Fortunately, he had not had to move Demic to get
his shirt off.

He heard raised voices in the house, but could not make out what
was being said. Demic did not seem impressed that Jack was
persisting with the task that Soldier Korst had set him, but there
was very little that the pained corpa could do to stop him.

"I'm sorry, this is going to be cold," Jack apologised as he wrung
out the linen rag.

Demic glared angrily, his jaw clenched, as Jack wiped his face
clean. From there, he worked downwards the same way Minnie would
have washed him, though he imagined that he was much gentler. The
thought made him smile.

Demic hissed as the cloth scraped over the left side of his chest,
but he either chose not to complain, or could not.

Jack finished washing Demic's upper body before either malkemist
returned. Demic's pants had blood stains on them, but Jack figured
that could wait and fetched him a clean shirt instead.

"No," said Demic. "Not yet. Blanket."

Jack left him there to tend to the horses. He could not see a well,
but fortunately the trough was full. None of the horses had been
ridden hard, but they had all had a saddle on since before dawn.

Jack took off all the saddles and hung them on the veranda rail. He
then unhitched the nag, but immediately regretted it. She had been
holding the cart still, and as soon as it was unhitched it began to
roll backwards. He was forced to let go of her to catch the cart
before it took off. The nag moved off to graze and he was left
holding the cart in place like an idiot. He tried to call her back,
but she did not so much as lift her head from the grass, as he
clicked, clucked, and crooned for her attention.

Risle came over, but she was more hinderance than help. He almost
lost his hold on the cart altogether as she nudged him
affectionately. The situation was feeling desperate, with the cart
pulling strongly against his hold, despite the gentleness slope. He
imagined Corpa Demic careening back down the track, off into the
field, to finally crash among the trees. The mental image was so
vivid it gave him a cold chill from his crown down.

Eventually, it occurred to him that he could use the veranda as a
stop. He angled the cart back $towards the house and let it roll
backwards until it gently bumped up against the veranda. Demic gave
a growl on the contact, but made no remark.

He jumped up onto the veranda to grab a piece of firewood and
chocked the wheel opposite the corner of the cart that was now
resting against the veranda.

Jack took a deep breath in relief and went to rub down the animals,
starting with Risle.

Not knowing the animals, he haltered them to the veranda, all
except Risle and the nag. He thought he could trust those two, and
Risle did stay close, but when he looked about to rub down the nag,
she was threatening to disappear into the treeline.

He ran a few paces $towards the trees, but he so encumbered in his
boots that he stopped. Reaching down, he was about to loosen his
laces when Risle nudged his side, almost sending him sprawling.

<i>Was it possible?</i> he wondered. Without considering any
further he moved to her side and tried to jump up onto her bare
back.

Not even close. He put his hand on the ridge of her shoulders the
next time and managed to get his ribs onto her back, and from there
he squirmed the rest of the way.

He set her off at a gallop, and it felt good. It felt natural. This
was the way he was meant to ride. Jack grinned the entire way.

He made it to the nag only to $realise that he had not grabbed a
halter, and he swung around to go get one.

When he fixed his sights on the house, he $realised that the two
malkemists were standing on the veranda watching him. Jack urged
Risle up to the veranda rail self-consciously to take a halter.

"Leave her be, she's fine. She won't go anywhere," said the Old
Man. Jack let the halter fall back onto the rail, a little
disappointed.

The Old Man went to the cart and addressed Demic.

"Are you ready to get that air out of your chest boy?"

Demic nodded.

"Do you want to sleep for it?"

Demic shook his head with a frown, perhaps offended by the
question.

"Brave boy. I'm not going to lie, this is going to sting a little.
In fact, that's probably an understatement. There's no avoiding the
first needle. I've made a few tools to make this go easier, but
I've just created them, so they won't last long. Let's hope we
don't have to do this twice."

Jack dismounted and climbed into the cart opposite the Old Man. In
contrast, Soldier Korst took a seat on the veranda, content to let
the other man handle everything.

Jack watched intently as the Old Man laid out a bundle of cloth on
Demic's stomach, untied a string, and unfurled it with his dry
leathery hands. Inside was a row of glass and metal tools nestled
inside individual cloth pouches.  The Old Man withdrew a glass
cylinder and something that looked like a glass rod with a wide
head at the end. He pushed the head of the rod into the cylinder
and pushed the snug fit to the end.  Finally, he took a metal pin
from its pouch and attached it to the end of the cylinder before
putting the whole assembly aside.

The Old Man saw Jack's intense interest and laughed. "You act like
you've never seen a syringe before."

Jack had never seen a syringe before and the Old Man knew it.

He pulled a small dish from one of the pouches and then a vill from
his pocket. Jack noticed that he did not wear a vest like most
malkemists. He poured a modest amount from the vill into the dish,
though still far more than the small vill should have contained. He
put the metal tip of the syringe into the liquid, and pulling back
on the glass rod, drew it into the cylinder. He gave the cylinder
a few flicks with his pointer finger, a pointless gesture as far as
Jack could see, then began a strange finger dance over Demic's
ribs. He seemed to be counting, but he stopped a little below the
line that connected the armpit with the nipple.

"Here comes the tickle," warned the Old Man.

Jack watched in horror as the Old Man pushed the syringe in over
one rib and under another, driving upwards into the chest. He could
almost hear the metal scrape on bone as it went in. Yet, Demic's
face was immobile. He did not even clench his jaw. Perhaps Jack was
doing enough of that for the both of them.

Then, as though his control had reached its limit, Demic's face
screwed up in pain and he gasped.

Finally, the long, slow push stopped. The Old Man began withdrawing
the tip, all the while pushing the liquid out of the syringe. By
the time the metal tip came clear of Demic's skin, the syringe was
empty.

"That'll work quickly. Don't move, I'll want to push the next
monster in through the exact same hole."

The Old Man set aside the syringe and took out another two vills.
From the first he began pouring a liquid into his palm, but it did
not react like any liquid that Jack had ever seen before. It clung
to itself and, with a life of its own, formed into a long thin
metal rod. It was much, much thicker than the metal tip of the
syringe, but otherwise looked very similar. Jack leaned so far
forward, his eyes wide, that he had to catch himself with a hand on
Demic's leg. Excitement was coursing up and down his body. He had
never seen something, a real thing, created out of nothing before.
The liquids did not count, that could almost make sense. This was
different. This was magic.

"Back up boy. Don't breath on me."

The Old Man placed the large needle among his other equipment and
Jack reached out and touched its base tentatively, afraid that it
might fall apart like a dry mud ball. The man gave him a
disapproving look, but was too busy with his second vill to
comment.

From the second vill came a long clear tube, perhaps slightly
longer than Jack's arm. It looked a little like the gel that the
malkemists used to protect themselves, but more solid and it did
not shimmer.

"Boy! Grab me a bucket of water."

Jack started and almost got up before he $realised that the Old Man
was talking over his shoulder at Soldier Korst.

The Old Man tapped Demic's chest where the needle had gone in. "Can
you feel that?"

Demic shook his head.

"Varley, here goes." He looked at Jack. "If you're squeemish, I
suggest you go for a walk."

Without waiting for a response from Jack, he picked up the large
needle he had just created, and placed it against the small red dot
where the first needle had gone in. Jack suddenly $realised what he
was going to do with the large needle, and he did begin to feel a
little sick.

The Old Man pressed the head of the needle against the lower rib,
pushing it down slightly, and then began sliding it into Demic's
flesh. Jack held his breath.

The Old Man had closed one eye and was squinting intently at
Demic's chest with the other. The needle seemed to catch on flesh,
rocking the boy's whole chest, but Demic himself did not seem to
feel any more pain than he was already enduring. In the needle
went, on and on, until Jack wondered why it needed to be so deep.
He felt the beginnings of numbness creeping up his tongue, and
quickly took a deep breath to forestall it. He dared not swallow.

The Old Man took the tube and slowly inserted it into the end of
the large needle. Jack was not surprised to see that it slipped
snuggly inside. The Old Man pushed the tube in until his thumb and
forefinger, clamped almost a hand from the end of the tube, was
stopped by the base of the big needle.

Soldier Korst returned with a bucket of water, and the Old Man
dropped the other end of the tube into it before hanging the bucket
from the side of the cart. The end of the tube began to issue slow
bubbles into the water and the Old Man nodded his head in
satisfaction.

"That went well," exhaled the Old Man with some relief.

Demic's body was slowly relaxing, though his face still showed
strain.

"The lung should expand soon enough and then you'll be right as
rain." The Old Man reach up to his right eye, pulled down his
bottom eye lid, pushed it back into place with his finger, and then
blinked down once. Something fell from his eye into his left palm
and he blinked a couple of times rapidly. For a moment, Jack
thought that some part of his eye had fallen out, and he drew back.
But when the Old Man refocused his gaze, Jack saw that his eye was
fine.

"Silly boy," the Old Man chuckled at Jack. He packed up his tools
before going to the trough. He splashed some water over his hands,
then fiddled with the metal contraption at the end of the trough
that Jack had mistaken for an ornament. A heavy, very rusty,
ornament. He lifted a lever, then pushed it down, and suddenly
water was gushing from a spout, filling the trough anew.

Jack was foolish enough to leave the cart for a closer look, his
upset stomach almost forgotten. The she-dog nudged him with her
mighty head as he went to investigate, and the Old Man roped him
into working the lever as soon as he got near. Jack did not mind
too much. It allowed him to try to puzzle out how it worked. <i>How
could water come gushing out of a spout just from pushing a
lever?</i>

"Now boy, what are you going to do about that dog?" the old man
asked, his eyes on the she-dog as he straightened from the trough,
and his tone demanding that something be done. This time Jack knew
well enough that it was not him who was being asked the question.

"Your dogs will grow their nuts back when we leave. Problem
solved," Soldier Korst answered with his usual tact.

"Don't play with me boy. That's a simulcra or I'm a ten-year-old
myself. And I can see clear as day who it's attached to. And it's
transitioning! I want to know why before I kick your ass!"

"You could try."

The Old Man gave him a long hard look. "Your pretty wolf suit can't
stop me bruising your ego. Not by a long shot."

Soldier Korst changed tack suddenly, as though no confrontation had
been building. "The dog belongs to Mond."

"And where is Mond?" asked the Old Man with a sharp and suspicious
look.

"Dead." Soldier Korst puckered his lips, and his eyes scrunched as
though expecting a blow. Perhaps he was.

The Old Man took a moment to consider that.

"Then why does it cling to the boy like he created it?"

Soldier Korst had no answer for him, so the Old Man continued. "Not
that I'm not relieved to hear that you're not stupid enough to
sponsor a non-malkemist to use malkemy. The last thing we need is
some master or other deciding to knock that saw-dust out from
between your ears. Goodness knows what they'd replace it with.

"Did Mond place a compulsion on the creature?"

"No. It happened before Mond died. Went to the boy all by
itself. Strange really, but we didn't think much of it at the
time."

"Strange is right. Very strange," the Old Man mused. "So, why
haven't you killed it?"

Soldier Korst opened his mouth to defend himself, stuttered, then
gave up the effort and closed his mouth. He took a deep breath
before trying again.

"I needed it. A malkemist attacked us," one of the Old Man's
eyebrows rose, "and a dozen men. I thought we might be attacked
again."

The Old Man nodded his head as though that was quite reasonable,
then reiterated coldly, "Why haven't you killed it?"

Soldier Korst stared at the other man a moment before sighing.
After only a moment's delay he started moving toward the she-dog.

A jolt of alarm ran through Jack and he stopped pressing the lever
to step in front of the she-dog. She was having none of that
however, and as though she knew exactly what Soldier Korst was
about, she pushed ahead and gave a bass growl of warning. Her
hackles rose to make her appear even more massive than she already
was. The soldier reached into his coat and pulled out a vill. Jack
struggled to put himself between the two, but the she-dog easily
edged him out with her heavy body.

"Wait," called the Old Man, before falling quiet for a pensive
moment. "You know what? I've never seen anything like it, and I'm
quite sure that no one at Pamsley has either. I'll write a letter
for you to take to Waisel. It'll keep you out of trouble, and
then he can decide the creature's fate. How long has it been out?"

"Since sundown yesterday," replied the soldier. He was trying to
appear uncaring now, but Jack could tell that he was relieved.

"It'll start to get hungry sometime tomorrow then, you'll want to
have enough meat on hand to feed it."

"It can't wait the two days to Pamsley?"

"Possibly, but remember that the feeling of hunger will be new to
it. It's your call. Do you like the idea of having a hungry and
confused animal that size wandering around?"

"Hmm," the soldier acknowledged.

Jack noticed Demic peering over the seat of the cart, his face
haggard, but free of pain. Soldier Korst went to his own horse and
gave it a pat.

"How do you know so much about simulcra?" he asked in a suspicious
tone. "Those two?" He gestured $towards the veranda.

"I've read accounts dealing with human simulcra. Obviously you
can't ask a dog how it's feeling. Or you can, but it doesn't get
you far. As for my dogs, you're welcome to inspect them for
yourself." The Old Man smiled. It was definitely a challenge.

Soldier Korst grunted and changed the topic.

"What's for dinner?"

"I don't know, but you'd better start now if it's going to be
cooked in time." On his way back to the house, he called out to
Demic. "Don't you accidently pull that tube out! I won't be using
any painkiller if I have to put it back in."

When both malkemists had disappeared into the house, Jack went and
helped Demic sit up in the cart.

"You're good at this. I might make you my personal manservant when
the masters at Pamsley are through poking at you," commented Demic,
obviously feeling much better.

"How's the pay?" Jack shot back.

"More than you'll see otherwise I expect, but probably not enough
to keep your dog in food," he smirked.

Jack considered that a moment, then changed the topic.

"Do you know the Old Man?" he asked.

"I don't know him, but I know of him. He's very famous. A famous
healer named Rainier. He's also very old, though he doesn't look
it. It's a taboo subject. Old malkemists, I'm talking about ancient
malkemists, disapproved of extending life through malkemy. But
since it wasn't written into the Semicron, it isn't prohibited,
just frowned upon."

Jack nodded slowly as though he understood.

"And how does Soldier Korst know him?"

Demic barked a laugh and then immediately winced.

"Korst is his son," Demic said a little breathlessly and Jack felt
his eyebrows rise in surprise. "Korst is a good soldier, but no
where near as powerful as his father. I've heard that Rainier is
very disappointed by his son, but the same talk says that it was no
surprise, since he only fathered children on Koyim."

"Is that bad?"

Demic's mouth quirked sideways. "It depends who you talk to. It
isn't forbidden, but the child of a koyim is only rarely a
malkemist. On top of that, the training is essential. Without it,
even the most powerful of malkemists would be unable to do the
simplest thing. Such a child is never powerful though."

Jack pondered that for a few moments.

"And what about me?"

"I don't know. Master Amoth apparently had no idea either, from
what I overheard about you, they seemed to think you're a
curiosity. You obviously cannot be taught malkemy, but perhaps
there are other things you can do spontaneously that will be more
useful. Mond was quite a powerful soldier," Demic pointed $towards
the she-dog. "Very few soldiers would be able to create and
maintain a beast as large as Dolce, but it seems that you stole the
link to her away somehow, and unless she has quickened, you are
maintaining her now."

"Dolce," Jack repeated. "That's a very gentle name."

"Yes, Mond could have a biting sense of humour at times. You saw.
She's anything but gentle."

"Yeah. It almost makes me believe the other stories they told about
her," Jack watched Demic carefully for his reaction.

"I'd be careful about believing too much of what a malkemist says.
They're great storytellers. Though I happen to know most of what
they told you about Dolce was true."

Demic took a tentative deep breath and seemed relieved by the
result.

"We need to be careful of those two Jack. It isn't in Soldier
Korst's best interests to allow the story of what happened this
morning to go beyond us."

"Huh? Why would he kill you after going to so much trouble to keep
you alive?"

"Not kill, stupid," he corrected in mild consternation. "Wipe our
memories."

"He can do that?!" Jack asked, wide-eyed.

"No, not Korst. But his father certainly could. It's a villend for
a chemical that attacks the brain. Specifically, new connections in
the brain. Any recently grown connections die off, and new
connections don't grow for a few hours after the dose. We would
forget the last twenty hours or so like they never happened."

"How do we stop them?" Jack asked, horrified at the idea that he
could lose his memories. "Protect ourselves?"

"We cannot. Anything we try will be detected, or they will deliver
the villend in a way that I never anticipated. I'm a baby compared
to Master Rainier."

"Then how?" asked Jack, feeling dependant and stupid, and not
liking the sensation.

"We need to write ourselves an account of what happened, and we
have to do it quickly. I'll need your help to fill in the things
that I missed."

"Varley," Jack quickly agreed. He was fascinated by the idea.

"Good. Fetch my saddlebags to me."

Jack jumped to the veranda from the back of the cart and ran to
Demic's saddlebags and pulled them from the rail.

Demic quickly found a pen and ledger among his things, and began
writing. Jack noticed that he placed a second piece of loose paper
beneath the page, along with a blue sheet, before he began writing.
His handwriting was fast, neat, and fluid. Jack watched in awe as
sentence after perfect sentence flowed onto the paper. The
corpa began by describing their party and the purpose of their
trip, even going so far as to describe Jack as an annoying
tag-along. Demic gave Jack an apologetic smile when he $realised
that Jack was reading along.

All too quickly the narrative arrived at the pre-dawn attack and
Jack learned how Soldier Mond had died. Two black clad men had
snuck into the camp, somehow scented to confuse the dogs. They had
both simultaneously attacked a malkemist each. One had succeeded.

Demic seemed to dwell uncomfortably long on Dolce's defection to
Jack, and even the way Risle had fought to keep him safe during the
attack.

"Keep an eye on the house Jack, if they know that we are writing
something, they will search for and destroy it while we cannot form
memories." He flipped to the next page and Jack saw that the loose
page underneath contained an exact copy of what the corpa had
written.

He wrote the aftermath of the attack as though it had been Jack's
idea to put the wounded to a merciful death. Jack insisted that he
amend it to show that Demic begged him to do it.

They settled on "asked."

Demic's recollection faltered when he was shot, and Jack described
his run back to camp and what Soldier Korst had done to keep Demic
alive. He tried to copy the clean way that Demic made meaning
appear on the page, but he mostly failed, and Demic ended up
changed most of what he said before it appeared in ink.

The front door to the house opened suddenly, and Jack quickly
covered the book in the straw while pretending to help Demic sit
more confortably. He noticed that Demic seemed much stronger.

"Are we ready to tear that tube out yet?" asked Master Rainier.

Demic nodded.

"Good then, lie back and I'll have it out in a red minute."

Jack helped ease Demic back down, though he no longer felt the
other boy needed assistance. Master Rainier rubbed his dry palms
together with some relish. He reach out and touched the large
needle in Demic's side, it became transparent and then drew back
$towards his hand, similar to the way Soldier Korst's dog had
disappeared. It was only then that Jack saw the vill in the tricky
Old Man's palm. Demic winced.

Master Rainier had a very small, very slim knife in his hand, and
he used it to slice the tube off almost at Demic's flesh. He cast
Jack a conspiratorial wink, though Demic could see the wink just as
clearly as Jack. He put the vill he had just used away in one
pocket and then withdrew a new one from a different pocket.

From this new vill he released a single drop of liquid into the end
of the tube sticking out of Demic's chest. He swapped vills yet
again, and with this new one he sucked the tube in Demic's chest
out of existence.

Demic gave a short cry, but it was the cry of anticipated pain that
never arrives.

"Done," declared Master Rainier, and he jumped off the card and
headed back $towards the front door of the house.

However, things were clearly not done from Jack's perspective. The
relatively small wound left by the needle was knitting itself
together in front of Jack eyes. It was clear because this time
there was no wash of blood to hide what was going on. When the
whole event seemed to have exhausted itself, Jack reached a hand
into the bucket and wiped away the blood on Demic's chest.

The flesh underneath was unmarred.

"Looks good," said Jack.

"Yes," said Demic in relief. "I was scared he was going to wipe us
both there and then." Jack felt a jolt. He had not even considered
the possibility. "Perhaps he's waiting for the villend to charge,"
he mused. "Quick, let's get back to it."

Jack withdrew the ledger and pen, and Demic set to writing again.
He prompted Jack for different details, and Jack mechanically
recalled everything that had happened right up to the point where
Demic could fill in the rest for himself.

Penultimately, Demic recounted his suspicion that Soldier Korst,
with the help of Master Rainier, might wipe the last day from their
minds.

Finally, he wrote, "Corpa Jack rendered invaluable and unasked for
service in preserving my life. I am in his debt and intend to draw
him into my service as my manservant upon the approval of my
father, at twenty percent more than the nominal rate."

Jack, who did not know what twenty percent of anything was,
immediatiely interjected "thirty percent."

Demic gave him a very cool, yet amused look, and wrote on, "Nay,
thirty percent." He signed his name underneath and then passed the
pen to Jack.

Jack printed his name with painful slowness, and embarrassing
crudeness.

Once done, Demic took the book back and separated each written page
from the copy that had transferred to the paper beneath each. He
gathered the loose papers up and then folded them three times
before handing them to Jack.

"Store those deep in your saddlebags, but make sure you're not
seen. I'll tear mine out and do the same.

This was Jack's element, and had no difficultly making the pages
disappear, both immediately, and then deep into his saddlebags.
Somebody watching over his shoulder would not have seen what he was
about. When he returned, Demic was standing on unsteady legs by the
cart.

"I'm thirsty."

Jack used his eyebrows to indicate the bucket beside Demic on the
cart.

"Very funny. Clean water please."

Jack took the bucket and carried it $towards the raised beds of
vegetables by the side of the house.

"What did your last manservant die of?" Jack asked as he swung the
bucket side-to-side with his gait.

"Complications arising from too much sass?" shot back Demic.

Jack laughed, though he did not completely understand. He emptied
the water among some leafy greens and took the bucket back to
refill at the spout.

As Demic was drinking, Dolce came to nuzzle Jack's hand, and he
absently rubbed her head. He felt some tension leave him. Even the
nag looked like she was wandering back.

"Ah!" Jack exclaimed suddently. "I should've made you write that
you'd teach me more words."

"You want more words?" asked Demic, as though ready to grant them,
there and then. "Oh, wait. Not much use if you're about to forget
everything your brain grew to remember today. Don't worry too much,
my manservant needs to be able to read."

Jack pulled out his list of words anyway, frowning at the tattered
state of the paper. As he opened up the folds he noticed a hole
worn through on a point that had been a corner. Demic took the
abused paper gingerly, his face openly appalled.

"My tutor would have beaten me for treating her instruction so
disrespectfully. You're lucky I don't have her arm." He took his
ledger and pen from his saddlebags again, and added another twenty
words to the list. His flowing script contrasted with the simple
print that both Master Amoth and Archivist Melanie had used.

Jack found the word sounds that Demic recited, and their written
pairings, simple to match. He $memorised them all very quickly.

"Probably a wasted effort. We're both likely to be drooling idiots
by the time those two put us to bed tonight."

***

When Soldier Korst called them in for dinner, they had both bathed
and changed clothes. Jack had some trouble at the front door with
Dolce, who wanted to follow him into the house. Master Rainier was
quite adamant that she not enter.

"No dogs in the house!"

He tried pushing her back over the threshold, but she ignored his
pitiful efforts.  He tried to order her back, but that was just as
effective. Eventually, he had to walk back outside and coax her to
stay with soft words in her ear.

When he did manage to get inside without her, the first thing he
noticed was the open space. There were no rooms, only a couple of
pillars spaced evenly in the centre of the room, holding the roof
up. The next thing he noticed was the sheer number of books. He was
surprised, though perhaps he should not have been. There were
easily double the number of books here than at Sparrow Library.
Staring up at it all, he was impressed, though he felt a twinge of
disloyalty $towards Master Amoth for the feeling.

"No need to gawke boy. You can read whatever you understand after
dinner," called Master Rainier from the dining table.

The tables, the chairs, and the many bookcases were beautifully
crafted, as Jack had come to expect from malkemists on the whole.
Yet, when he looked at the floor, he saw that it was unswept. Nor
was it the neglect of a week. This looked to be the serious
uninterest of years, perhaps even decades. Dust was piled up high
in visible mounds on the floor.

Jack was shocked. As poor as he had been his entire life, even the
meanest hovel he had called home had had a neatly swept floor. He
put the tip of his boot to a nearby dune, just to check that it
yielded as he expected. It really was a small mound of dry dust.

Soldier Korst came through the back door carrying plates of roasted
meat and vegetables, answering a question that Jack had not even
had time to form for himself. He $realised that the kitchen must be
on the back veranda.

"Wash your hands out the back and then come sit down corpas,"
growled Soldier Korst, as though they should have known to do so
without him having to say a word.

In the middle of dinner, Master Rainier addressed himself to Demic.

"Korst tells me that your father has allowed you to create
villends. He must be extremely confident that you will pass your
examination."

"The Imaginers have tested me themselves. The examination with the
Gatekeepers is a formality," Demic replied stiffly.

"A formality?" Master Rainier scoffed. "I've never heard it
referred to as a mere formality before. You must show extraordinary
promise for the Imaginers to be so assertive."

"I am stronger by far than the most powerful malkemist in living
memory," Demic was going to say something more, but Master Rainier
interjected.

"Oh, stop it," he smiled. "You're giving me goosebumps. In living
memory you say? Mine stretches back a ways, you're sure you want to
stand by that?"

Demic looked a tad uncertain, but he did not back down.

Master Rainier continued. "Unlike you, I was alive the last time
the Imaginers decided that they had found the Vern, the one that
would clean up our rotting libraries, once and for all. Chap named
Busan if I recollect correctly. What a terrible disappointment he
turned out to be."

"I am stronger than Busan was."

"I'm sure. Sure. Yet strength will only get you so far. In fact, if
strength is as important as you seem to think, we may all find
ourselves bowing and scraping to the young corpa by your elbow.
Wouldn't that be the height of cutting irony?"

"He was never trained, and who knows what's really going on there.
It may be nothing when the masters finally examine him."

"True, I concede. But wouldn't it be exciting if he really did
turn out to be as powerful as changing a villend without a plith
crystal implies. That's some awful heavy lifting, and from the
sound of it, he does it as naturally as breathing." Master Rainier
lifted his cup to Jack, and Jack could think of nothing else to do
but return the gesture, which tickled a laugh from the master.

"The thought of it appalls me be honest," he continued. "I'd see it
for myself. I'd like to disprove the ridiculous notion. I cannot
believe it! Yet, a wiser part of me calls such rashness a waste of
a good villend. Maybe, I tell myself, I don't know my own mind on
this. And then I'm forced to conclude that I do give it credit.
Unfortunately, he'll never gain control of it, but there's a part
of my old reprobate heart that wishes it were possible. It'd be
worth it just to be able to sit back and enjoy the futile knashing
of teeth it would engender!"

"I was there when Master Greon tested him. He has no control over
the ability," Demic said sternly, as though he were the elder.

"Master Greon?" asked Master Rainier, changing tact with
disconcerting swiftness. "There's a man who used to enjoy a far
sunnier disposition. I hear he harbours a well-founded hatred of
your father. I'm quite surprised he didn't jump at the opportunity
to strike through you."

"The master of Sparrow Library forbade it."

"Yes. Master Amoth. A kind heart one he is. Most atypical of a
malkemist. He's lucky to have hard-headed friends to pick up the
slack for him. His wife! Now there's a woman I'd cross the road to
avoid a duel with." He chuckled into his wine before continuing.
"But you'd be wise to fear Greon. It would not surprise me in the
least if he has set some slow ticking trap for you. Snap! No more
Corpa Demic, the presumptive Vern."

Soldier Korst, who had been eating single-mindedly without special
regard to the conversation chuckled at that.

"I hope the prick waits until these two are safely in Grandmaster
Waisel's hands before springing anything."

"I hardly think that Demic's father will recall you just because
his son has arrived at Pamsley," warned Master Rainier. "Corpa
Demic's safety will be your long term responsibility. Which, by
extension, will make Master Greon your long term problem."

"There are enough masters at Pamsley to keep these corpa safe, and
a host more besides."

"I doubt Grand Imaginer Peele has any of your unwavering faith in
them."

Soldier Korst returned to his food without a rejoiner.

"Corpa Jack?" said the master, politely asking for Jack's
attention.

Jack looked up from his food, abandoning his ruse of ignorance.

"How much have they told you about the history, the purpose, of the
malkemists?"

Soldier Korst gave his father a hard look, and Corpa Demic spoke in
a sudden quick rush.

"That's forbidden knowledge for the uninitiated!"

"True. I'm sorry. I did forget that you're uninitiated yourself
Corpa Demic," said Master Rainier, stressing the title. "Your air
of worldly knowledge disarmed my caution." He laughed heartily at
that. "As the son of an important imaginer, let's not kid, you
would know the malkemist articles of purpose backwards and
forwards. Your examination? A formality indeed!"

"Jack is different," broke in Demic. "He's not meant to be a
malkemist. He will never be a malkemist!"

"I don't know," responded Master Rainier in a whimsical tone. "I
think we can trust the discretion of our young guests, Soldier
Korst. What do you think? They look like thoroughly trustworthy
characters to me."

Soldier Korst's face lightened as he listened to his father, until
Jack could almost see them thinking on the same track.

"I trust them," said Soldier Korst through a new mouthful of meat.

"Trust is a beautiful thing," the master smiled. "Of course, Corpa
Demic could tell you everything I'm about to tell you. He shouldn't
be able to by rights, given that every corpa should arrive before
the Gatekeepers completely ignorant of malkemy. The only
instruction a corpa once received was how to listen to himself. His
true self or higher self. I'd like to pretend with you that it was
completely different in my day," he put on a gruff voice, "when men
were men and nonsense wasn't tolerated. But the truth is, the last
true malkemist probably died many, many centuries before I was
born." Jack saw Demic frown fiercely at that, but kept quiet. "We
live amid fragile lies now. We pretend that the corpas go to their
examinations without preparation, while each is in fact carefully
schooled since infancy. Even the Gatekeepers themselves must study
to perform their roles. As a group we have always adored books, but
the prohibition against writing about the particulars of malkemy,
of its experience and the sense of purpose that each malkemist
gained when connected to his higher self was so strong that when
the malkemists began to decline, the art of malkemy was recorded in
shameful secret by men and women who no longer understood their
purpose truthfully. The articles of purpose were recorded, I
imagine, from the poorest vessels of knowledge, malkemists who only
recalled scraps. Bottom feeders desperate to retain a connection to
the world of malkemy. Meanwhile, the titans, the shining exemplars,
refused with terrible forbidding to share their deeper
understanding. If you read the articles of purpose, they are tinged
with awe for those towering giants of real purpose, and hints of
jealousy. We are all bottom feeders now. We may as well be koyim
for all the pretty tricks we managed to preserve."

Soldier Korst shook his head in denial, a moue of distaste on his
mouth, but he did not interupt his father. Demic held no such
compunction.

"The prohibition was only for the koyim!" he erupted.

"Apologetics!" cried Master Rainier, glaring at Demic. "What
utility could a true malkemist have for those sickly and pale
reflections of knowledge?!"

Demic balked, his eyes wide at the forceful rebuke. Meanwhile,
Soldier Korst looked completely unsurprised with his eyebrows high
and his eye hooded. His face said, <i>I do not discuss such things
with my father.</i>

"Why didn't the real malkemists want to share? If they were so
good, why didn't they want to help?" asked Jack.

"Excellent question, Corpa Jack," he said, as though taking him
seriously for the first time. "The answer is quite obvious if you
are willing to $criticise the malclave." His eyes flashed at Demic.
"They refused to pass on that specific knowledge because it was
destructive. The purpose, when divorced from a deeper, more
nuanced understanding, becomes terrible. The skill of malkemy gives
advantage to those without the wisdom necessary to wield that
advantage. Just as tenology gave undue advantage to the koyim,
their minds and intellects unable to appreciate the impact of their
actions."

He took a sip of his wine before continuing.

"Can you guess at the guiding purpose of the malclaves Corpa Jack?"

Jack had no idea, though he was beginning to see a pattern in the
master's explanation. He shook his head.

"You're sure you wouldn't like to guess? No? Varlay." His eyes yet
again flicked $towards Demic as he spoke on. "The purpose of the
malkemists is to keep knowledge out of the hands of anyone without
the wisdom to apply it."

"No!" Demic rejoined angrily. "That's not the definition at all! We
are dedicated to keeping tenology out of the hands of the koyim."

"Yes, that's what I said," said Master Rainier in a far milder
tone, his tongue literally in his cheek.

Soldier Korst, who had just finished the food on his plate, forked
some more meat from the platter in the $centre of the table, almost
fiercely ignoring his father's words.

"The point, Corpa Jack, is that corruption set in as soon as the
purpose was stated and the lesser men who followed began treating
it as gospel. We know almost nothing of the real malkemists..."

"We are real malkemists," grumbled Demic. He did not lift his eyes
up this time to challenge Master Rainier.

"You're not even a counterfeit one yet corpa!" Master Rainier
glared at the top of Demic's head. The boy's face drew close enough
to his food that he probably did not need the fork in his hand.

"We know nothing about <i>real</i> malkemists, because they
understood the danger of knowledge without wisdom. Perhaps the
largest gaping hole in our knowledge is what their connection to
their higher selves meant to them. It's strange, because it seemed
to be one of the only things they spoke of openly to everyone and
anyone, and yet, for some reason, the bottom feeders never recorded
it. Perhaps it was so mundane for them, so lacking in glamour, that
they didn't value it.

"As less and less malkemists were able to achieve this connection
to their higher self, the more ridiculed the general idea became.
To even mention it now is to invite rude scoffing and rolled eyes.
At best!"

The table was quite. Neither Demic nor Soldier Korst looked
particularly comfortable, but they both remained silent as the
master's words faded from aural memory. Jack let himself relax back
into eating his meal.

"How's your food Corpa Jack?" asked Master Rainier after the
clatter of dinnerware had dominated for a while. Jack nodded by way
of appreciation. "Korst is no culinary genius, by any stretch of
the imagination, but he does have a certain flair for barbequing
the flesh of dead animals. Though if you spend much more time in
his company, you might learn to detest meat, since it's all he
eats."

Soldier Korst did seem to count defending himself against this
charge worthy of his energy.

Jack finished his food and immediately asked, "Can I read now?"
Master Rainier looked a little startled for a instant, but after
swallowing a mouthful of food, he nodded once.

"I did say you could, didn't I. No harm I guess."

Jack rose.

"No, no. Ask first," said Master Rainier.

Jack subsided back into his seat, feeling a little connfused and
anxious. Demic came to his rescue.

"You say: may I be excused from the table."

Jack repeated the phrase dutifully.

"Yes, you may, Corpa Jack."

Jack got up and push his chair in. Then, taking a step back, he
bowed to the table.

"Oh, my!" exclaimed Master Rainier. "That almost makes me nostalgic
for civilisation. Go wash up, and if I like the look of your hands,
I'll show you how to respect my books."

"Don't forget your plate. No one here is washing that for you,"
scolded Soldier Korst.

When Jack returned, and his hands passed inspection, Master Rainier
invited him to select a book. Jack walked to the nearest bookcase
and began peering at the titles on the spines. He clasped his hands
behind his back in the way he had seen Master Amoth wander around
his study. Occasionally, a title would not be on the spine, and he
would have to ease the book out to look at the front cover. He
found several books that seemed promising, but he always moved on,
unwilling to commit. At one point he was deciphering a particularly
troublesome title when Soldier Korst commented over his shoulder.

"Now that's some lovely light reading before bed."

The title turned out to be, "Plagues: Causes and Consequences."
Jack moved on.

Eventually he read a single word that interested him very much, and
he carried the book back to the table. Master read the title out
loud.

"The Ethics of Creating Simulcra. That's a very interesting choice,
considering."

"You have more dishes to wash before you have time for that," broke
in Soldier Korst. He did not say it, but Jack heard "retard" loud
and clear.

To his surprise, Demic began clearing dishes right alongside him.
However, they got outside he was not much further help. He just
stood by the entire time and watched as Jack diligently scrubbed
and cleaned.

When they entered the house again, Master Rainier was offering
Soldier Korst something from a small lidded box.

"Corpas, you're just in time. Do take one." Master Rainier held
out the box.

As Jack approached, he saw two small brown eggs nestled in two
small divuts within the box. The other dozen or so spaces were
empty. Jack was curious, but confused. He had already eaten. <i>Why
would I want to eat a strange brown egg?</i>

Demic took an egg first, turned to Jack, and said simply. "It's
chocolate."

Jack felt a thrill of excitement. Chocolote. He had heard of
chocolate, but never seen it before. <i>What would it taste
like?</i>

He almost missed the look on Demic's face.

As he reached into the box and withdrew the last egg, it was
suddenly a struggle to keep the look of disappointment off his own
face.

Demic threw his egg into his mouth and then bit down on it
aggressively. Jack imagined he was saying, <i>you may have won the
battle, but you will not win the war</i>. He chewed and swallowed
without so much as a grimace, though neither did he make it seem
like much fun.

Jack tossed the chocolate egg into his mouth, opened his gullet,
and let it slide down to nestle in his throat. He moved his jaw as
though chewing, but with care to avoid working up any spit.

"Varlay corpas! Time to sleep," said Soldier Korst.

"How was your chocolate, Corpa Jack?" asked Master Rainier,
suddenly slapping Jack's back out of nowhere.

"Sweet," Jack replied. He had only barely controlled the impulse to
swallow.

"Yes, they are. Those aren't my $favourites. Far too much sugar.
You'll find your pallet over there by the maps."

"I need to pee," said Jack, heading for the front door. Nobody
tried to stop him.

Outside, Dolce was on him in an instant, and he staggered against
her as he made a beeline for the nearest tree. Once behind it, he
loosened his gullet and brought the chocolate egg up out of his
throat and into his palm.

It tasted so good.

Instead of trying to dig a hole, he turned and threw the egg far
into the field. Wiping his palm against the bark of the tree, he
hawked up as much saliva and chocolate as he could and spat it out.
He made a show of fastening his trousers as he came out from behind
the tree, but no one was outside on the veranda to see his fingers
fumbling in the dark. He washed the taste of the chocolate from his
mouth at the trough, delighting again in the operation of the lever
and spout, while Dolce lapped up water greedily beside him.

At the threshold to the house Dolce gave him some trouble, but she
was not as persistent as before. After a quick hug, she let him go.

He entered the house uncertainly, feeling foolish for not having
asked Demic for more details about how this villend was supposed to
affect him. Jack could see Demic lying in a pallet, either
sleeping, or pretending to.

"Come Jack," called Master Rainier, beckoning him from the fire.
Jack felt immediately suspicious. <i>Wasn't that it? Sleep, wake in
the morning, and pretend not to remember. What is this?</i> He had
already decided a plan where he looked to Demic for guidance when
he woke in the morning.

As Jack approached, his eyes played over the book he had selected.
It sat unattended on the table. He entertained the small hope that
he would be able to read it afterall.

"You can read that in the morning corpa, don't worry. Here, drink
this down."

Jack's stomach sank. <i>What if the chocolate was just
chocolate?</i> The thought of it appalled him worse than the idea
that he was about to drink the villend he had just struggled so
mightily to avoid. He may have thrown away real chocolate for no
good reason.

Master Rainier frowned at him, and Jack realised that he was taking
too long. He reached for and took the cup in the man's hand.
Silver, he noticed.

"I'm tired," Jack said to cover his hesitation.

"All's well, this will help with that."

"What is it?"

"Just something to help you sleep."

Jack wanted to tell him that he slept very well, all on his own,
but the master's firm tone left no room for evasions. Jack was
going to drink, it was only a matter of how. He sniffed at the cup
and recognised spices he had discovered in Minnie's kitchen, but
had not learned the names of. <i>It can't be that bad</i>, he
thought, and took a sip.

It tasted good. It had that much going for it, but each sip was
accompanied by the impulse to spit it out. In the end, the final
gulp did not taste very pleasant at all.

"Very good," beamed Master Rainier. "Off to bed with you."

Jack did exactly as he was told. He felt the same drowsiness he had
experienced when Minnie had drugged him, and thought he knew what
the two malkemists were about.

As he lay there, struggling to keep himself awake against the heavy
drag of the drug, he overheard Soldier Korst's angry voice.

"You were reckless. Like your theories haven't gotten you into
enough trouble over the years."

"Relax boy. They won't remember a thing in the morning, and I
enjoyed the audience. Even a poor audience is better than none. I
feel better for having gotten it off my chest. It doesn't do to let
such things fester."

"Pfft, that's been festering since before I was born. You know well
how to keep it to yourself."

"So I had some fun, let it..."

***

Jack woke to someone shaking him vigorously. Snot probably wanted
to eat. Jack felt a flash of irritation. <i>He knew better!</i>

Without opening his eyes, Jack clenched his fist and corked the
forearm that was shaking him. The cry of pain he had been expecting
did not sound at all like Snot.

Jack opened his eyes like a shot on Demic's surprised face.
Surprise that was quickly turning to anger.

"You hit me! What was that for?!" he demanded in an angry whine
that was frankly a little more annoying than the shaking.

Jack knew the answer to that question, but he would feel awkward
and stupid trying to explain it to Demic. Instead, he did the most
dignified thing he could think of. He ignored the question, and the
questioner.

"That really hurt! What did you think you were doing? I'll tell
Soldier Mond and he'll deal with you."

Jack turned away and looked about the room. He and Demic were
alone.

"Wait. Are you ignoring me?!" His outrage had changed tone, as
though Jack's temerity shocked him. "You don't ignore me! I'm Corpa
Demic, son of Grand Imaginer Peele! I'll have..."

"Hi, I'm Corpa Jack," said Jack calmly, not looking at Demic.

"I know who you are! Don't interupt me when I'm..."

"What do you remember?" Jack asked.

Demic's eyes bulged slighly, but the question shut him up. Jack
fought valiantly to keep the smug smirk he felt building inside
him, off his face.

Demic's narrowing eyes told him that he had failed.

Demic rocked back on his heels, and from the look on his face, Jack
could tell he was considering his situation from a different
perspective. A perspective within which Jack knew more than he did.
Jack caught himself thinking, <i>He's not stupid, just
arrogant</i>.

"I remember camping. You fell asleep with Soldier Mond's dog. I...
I must have slept."

Jack leaned in close to Demic and whispered, "Master Rainier took
your memory, but you wrote what happened, and put a copy in your
saddlebags."

"Master Rainier? Korst's father?"

Jack nodded.

"Why?"

"You almost died. I don't think they wanted anyone to know."

"I almost died?" Demic asked loudly, startling the both of them.
"How?" he continued much more quietly.

"You were shot during the attack."

"Attack? What attack?"

"Another malkemist and," Jack tripped on the word, "some koyim."

"We were attacked by another malkemist? It wasn't a duel?"

"Duel?" asked Jack, puzzled. "No. It was a surprise. They killed
Soldier Mond and tried to kill Soldier Korst."

"What? Mond? Impossible! I've seen him duel, he couldn't have
been..."

"He was killed in his sleep," Jack interupted, shocking Demic into
silence. Jack liked having pulled the wind from his sails.

The back door opened suddenly, and Soldier Korst marched in.

"Where are we Soldier Korst?" Demic demanded with an angry face.

"Master Rainier's home, but we'll be leaving now."

"How did I get here?" Demic's tone was stern.

Soldier Korst looked like he resented being put to the question,
but he answered anyway.

"We were attacked by another malkemist."

"He challenged you to a duel?" Demic asked.

"He attacked without warning and killed Mond."

"Impossible," said Demic. Jack noticed that Demic's refusal to
believe was just as strong as the moment before when Jack had told
him the same news.

"Why don't I remember it?" asked Jack.

Soldier Korst seemed relieved to be able to tell the final part of
his lie.

"He put everyone to sleep, except me. And I killed him."

That much was true, Jack remembered, though he noticed that Soldier
Korst made no mention of the dozen or so men that had attacked with
the malkemist. Jack suddenly saw a row of severed heads watching
him from the back of a log.

"We have to go," Soldier Korst pressured. "We've lost enough time
waiting for you two to wake up. Saddle your mules." Soldier Korst
left by the front door.

Demic stared into jack's eyes for a long moment.

"I find it very irritating that I trust you more than I trust him."

Demic followed Soldier Korst out of the house.

Dolce greeted Jack with her usual exuberance when he came out the
front door, almost dislogding the hastily wrapped package Jack had
tucked into the front of his trousers. He responded by stepping
sideways and giving her think neck a hug. He rubbed her meaty
brisket before slipping around her to get to his saddlebags. He
pushed the package inside before pulling his saddle off the rail.

Only the two mules and the two horses were outside, and Jack
assumed the other horses must be behind the house. He felt a firm
prickle of pleasure in his gut at knowing that.

Jack and Demic saddled their mounts and were ready to ride in short
order. Jack noticed for the first time that, despite his crippled
left hand, Demic could still saddle up without any help.

Master Rainier was in his garden tending to his sprawling plots. He
was ignoring their preparations completely.

Jack knew why that was too.

Soldier Korst paid Dolce unusual attention as she drank from the
trough, and Jack remembered with a twinge of worry that she would
want to eat soon.

Jack washed his face at the trough, but he barely had enough time
for a quick splash before Soldier Korst was urging them into the
saddle. The soldier gave a wave to his father and urged his horse
straight into a trot. They had only gone a hundred paces when
Master Rainier's dogs came pelting out from under the veranda, the
both of them posturing and barking.

"You mangy curs! Shut yer yaps ya useless cowards," cried Master
Rainier.

Jack almost laughed out loud, but caught himself just in time. He
did grin like an idiot most of the way down the track to the road
though. Fortunately, no one looked at him as they rode out.

On the road, Soldier Korst set a pace that was swifter than the
first day. Jack figured that it was because the soldier now had the
freedom to move between his own mount and Soldier Mond's, giving
both horses longer rests.

Sometime around midday Jack noticed Dolce struggling to keep up. He
kept an eye on her, and each time he looked, she was lagging farther
and farther behind. He was on the verge of calling out to Soldier
Korst when the soldier slipped out of the saddle to walk of his own
accord. Jack watched with relief as Dolce made up the distance
quickly and drew up beside him to pad along with them again.

He worried that she might not be able to keep up the entire day.

They had already passed through three towns, but Soldier Korst had
only watered the horses and replenished their waterbags at the
wells they had found.

The soldier called a stop to eat far from the last town.

Jack tried to feed Dolce some of his hard cheese, but Soldier Korst
put a stop to that.

"I'll have enough trouble as it is without you confusing her about
what food is. Just wait."

Jack was a little startled by the soldier's tone, and immediately
suspicious. He had sounded almost polite. Jack looked to Demic to
see if he had noticed Soldier Korst's strange behaviour, but he was
biting his lip in thought and far beyound noticing his
surroundings. Jack caught him casting a furtive glance at his
saddlebags before returning to his inner ponderings.

Jack felt a surge of assurance. He felt good for the first time
since he had made the mistake of robbing Sparrow Library. He felt
like he had a handle on his life again, and that everything was
going the way he expected it should. He let out a deep sigh. If he
knew what was going on around him, he could get out of its way
before it clobbered him.

He looked at Soldier Korst again. <i>Was the soldier happy because
he thought no one knew about Demic's near death?</i> If that was
the case, Jack doubted his good mood would hold for much longer.
<i>What is the best course for me though?</i> Could Demic be
trusted to handle this situation delicately? He might dump them
both into hot soup, and then Jack would be reduced to scrambling
for survival again. <i>Stuff that</i>.

Jack set himself to puzzling out the angles.

***

Dolce fell behind them again in the afternoon, and Jack lost his
train of thought to worrying about her. It was only when Soldier
Korst called a walk that Jack could watch with relief as she slowly
closed the gap again.

If only she were fed, she would be able to hold her own, Jack was
sure. He considered asking Soldier Korst to feed her. He would beg
if that was what it took. Yet the moment the words formed on his
tongue, he remembered that he should have no idea that Dolce needed
feeding, or that she was even growing hungry. Soldier Korst would
know that something was up as soon as he opened his mouth.

Jack subsided back into a tense silence with himself. He could not
say anything. On top of that, it aggravated him that neither Soldier
Korst, nor Demic, were paying the least attention to the failing
dog. She could disappear completely and they might not notice until
evening. If then.

When Dolce caught up, there were great gobs of saliva hanging from
her jaw and she was panting heavily. Jack could not contain himself
any longer.

"Soldier Korst!" he called. "Sirness, the dog is sick!"

Soldier Korst turned back halfway, then turned back.

"She's fine."

He had not even looked at Dolce.

The walked on, and the she-dog recovered herself enough not to be
panting madly. Jack fell behind the others to let her lap some
water from his palm. All too soon Soldier Korst was back in the
saddle, and Jack was watching Dolce fall behind again. Her head
hung low as she loped forward. She looked tired.

Jack turned back often, and each time she had retreated farther
from him, until he turned back at last and she was gone from sight.

When the soldier called the next walk, Jack waited for her shaggy
head to appear around the last bend behind them.

He was approaching the next bend and would soon pass around it.
Jack began to play a game of certainty with himself. He demanded
that she come back into sight before he passed the corner. He
gritted his teeth against the possibility of her remaining hidden
and convinced himself that she would appear. He glanced back often.
As the road behind was lost among the trees Jack kept his eyes on
the far bend. He willed her to appear.

She did not.

He should not have been surprised. He was no malkemist afterall.
They walked on and Dolce did not appear. When Jack finally climbed
back into his saddle, he had given up the hope of seeing her again.

The soldier chose a camp site just before sunset, and Jack became
busy with watering the mounts at a small creek that was little more
than a trickle of clear water on a bed of sand. Dolce was pressed
to the back of his mind as he began to consider how he could slip
into Demic's saddlebags and remove the original of the journal they
had made. Jack was not about to be swept into any danger on account
of Demic's recklessness. Unfortunately, Demic was right there
alongside him, watering his own mule.

When they arrived back at the camp Soldier Korst was preparing,
Jack inched up close to Demic.

"Here, let me take that for you," Jack offered as Demic prepared to
uncinch his saddle. Jack pressed in beside Demic to take the
saddle.

Demic shouldered his way back in angrily.

"I can handle my own saddle, thank you!" he growled. "I can do it
better than you, even with one hand."

Jack saw his mistake immediately and changed tack.

"It's not that. I've been doing it since you were shot," whispered
Jack. "You made me your manservant. I figured that's what I was
supposed to do."

"I can't have made you my manservant, I'd need my father's
permission for that."

"Yeah, that's what you said. But it's what I've been doing."

Demic took a deep breath through flared nostrils, but looked
mollified.

"Varley, but I can handle it," the crippled boy said much more
politely.

Jack, defeated, went to curry the other animals. Risle was playful
as he brushed her down, despite the long ride. She even bit his bum
while he was sliding the brush down her flank, and he almost cried
out before he $realised that it had not hurt. He whacked her on the
rump with the brush and she flapped her long ears down and back
briefly before letting them spring upright again.

It was a warning.

Jack smiled. He imagined she was saying: <i>games are fun, but
don't take them too far. That, was too far</i>. Jack moved on to the
horses.

He was halfway through rubbing down Soldier Mond's horse when Demic
appeared at his elbow.

"I can't find it!" he whispered fiercely.

"Can't find what?" asked Jack, his mind once again firmly on Dolce.
He figured it out before the last word was out of his mouth, but by
then he had to wait out Demic's indignation.

"The journal of course! I've searched my bags thoroughly! Where is
it?"

"Why are you looking for it now? Korst might see you!" whispered
back Jack, aiming to stall the other boy. He felt a small surge of
hope though. Perhaps fortune was smiling on him. He was snapped out
of his worry for Dolce by the choice he was suddenly presented
with. As soon as he passed his copy to Demic, the situation would
be out of his hands. He wondered if he could hold Demic off until
he had a better idea of what his plans were.

"I'll get it to you when it's safe," said Jack, casting a
surreptitious glance at Soldier Korst to strengthen the evasion.
Demic's lips tightened, but he gave a slight nod. "They must have
known you wrote something, and searched your bags when they put us
to sleep."

"Probably. Keeping a journal is a common habit, and Korst has seen
me write mine at night."

"What will you do if they found my copy as well?" Jack asked.

Demic frowned. "Nothing. I can't do anything without proof for my
father."

"And with proof?"

"With proof? They will pay. My father will handle them."

"You'll let your father know first?" Jack asked rhetorically. "So,
after we reach Pamsley." That sounded like a safe course to Jack.

Demic nodded impatiently and went back to his saddlebags.

With the animals happily munching away in their feed bags, Jack
screwed up his courage and approached Soldier Korst. The man was
kneeling with one knee up, gutting three small furry animals as the
fire gained heat.

"Sirness. The dog is still missing."

"I can see that," replied Soldier Korst without looking up from his
deft knife work.

"Maybe something happened to her."

"You'd know if something happened to your dog. You'd feel it." He
still did not look up.

"What if she's hurt, but I didn't feel it?"

The soldier's knife stopped moving and he took a deep breath before
looking Jack in the face.

He did not say a word. Instead, he lifted his knife until the blade
was pointed at Jack's stomach. A long strand of sticky blood
dripped from the wickedly sharp edge. He wrangled the blade for
Jack to step aside, then looked past Jack, his face suddenly
patient.

Jack followed the imaginary line the knife drew and caught sight of
the plodding outline of Dolce in the fading light. A wave of relief
washed over him and he started towards her.

"We couldn't lose that dog if we gave it a red hot go," commented
Soldier Korst behind him.

Jack was already running. For once he hardly noticed his clumsy
boots. He laughed when the two of them collided and she almost
knocked him to the ground. For once she did not crowd him and
smother him. Instead, it was Jack smothering her as she panted. He
led her to the creek for a drink, hoping to perk her up.

Taking handfuls of water from the stream, Jack washed the saliva
from her jowls. She shook her head in irritation, but he persisted
until she was clean. She looked much improved by the time he walked
her back to the camp.

Demic was seated cross-legged in the grass some distance from the
fire, a book opened between his knees, and his lighting villend
shining down on its pages. He gave Jack a significant look as he
returned, and Jack realised that he could not delay any longer. He
was about to go to his saddlebags when Soldier Korst cried out.

"Catch!"

Jack spun his head in time to see something sailing towards him.
Small, long, and thin. He snatched it out of the air with one hand.
It was one of the carcasses that the soldier had been cleaning. It
was warm and disturbingly flaccid as it curved around his hand. He
did not need to ask the soldier for the purpose of the raw meat.

"Thank you!" said Jack with real feeling.

Soldier Korst may have grunted, but Jack was not sure. He put the
small skinned animal in front of Dolce's face. She sniffed at the
carcass and then her large pink tongue gave it a solid lick. Almost
immediately, she licked it again, this time with even more
enthusiasm. Without further ceremony, her mouth closed over the
carcass and she yanked it effortlessly from Jack's grip. She padded
away a few paces and dropped to the ground with the meat between
her paws. Her jaws tore chunks of flesh away from the quickly
$unrecognisable body and the bones crunched between her molars as
she chewed.

"And I was worried she wouldn't have the instinct," said Soldier
Korst with a wry lilt to his voice.

Jack could smell a faint waft of cooking meat from the direction of
the fire, but that would not be ready for some time yet, and he had
something to give Corpa Demic. He went to his saddlebags, which
were lying on the ground as there were no suitably low branches
nearby. Inside, Jack found the journal entry tucked away behind a
flap of leather, exactly where he had left it. Even if Soldier
Korst had searched his saddlebags, it was unlikely that he would
have found it, because he would have needed to know about the flap
and then pull it up against all of the clothing inside to get under
it.

Jack slipped the journal entry up his sleeve. Next, he pulled out
the package he had slipped into the bag that morning. He peeled
back the paper that covered the book inside. Jack smiled softly as
he read the title. "The Ethics of Creating Simulcra." He doubted
that Master Rainier would miss it at all given his large
collection. It might be years, if ever, before the man went looking
for it again.

Jack had thrown the paper roughly around the book to disguise it
when he had carried it out of the house this morning. Now he took
some time to fold and crease the paper around the book more
thoroughly. He did not want Soldier Korst, or even Demic to catch a
glimpse of the stolen book. Once the paper cover was secure, he
walked back to Demic with it.

He passed behind Demic and carefully dropped the journal copy in
the grass behind the boy's back before sitting down a short
distance away. He set himself facing slightly towards Demic so that
he could see his face and Soldier Korst at the same time. Taking
out his tattered list of words, he held them out to the other boy.

Demic looked at them suspiciously.

"That's your word list. Where's the journal?"

"You already have it," Jack answered, smiling on the inside.

"Don't play with me, I ..."

"It's behind you in the grass. My word list please, I want to
study. You did say that your manservant needs to be able to read."
Jack opened his paper and pointed out Demic's handwriting at the
bottom of the list.

Demic scrutinised it in a cursory fashion. "If I'd done that to my
workbooks, my tutor would have beaten me bloody, and my father
probably would have helped."

"Yeah, that's what you said last time."

"At least I'm consistent."

Demic wrote and recited another set of twenty words for Jack. He
handed the tattered paper back, and then reached behind himself. A
few moments later he had the journal copy in front of himself. He
pressed the creases out against his textbook, and then began
hungrily devouring the text.

Jack opened his own book, but he was far too interested in watching
the emotions chase each other over Demic's face to pay much
attention to it. Demic's eyes would dart across the page quickly
for several moments, and then return to a higher point to read more
slowly. On the last page his features became cold and clenched.

Suddenly, he gave a short bark of a laugh and looked up at Jack.

"Thirty percent, huh? You worth all that?" he asked.

"I'm worth more," said Jack with a serious face, and Demic
chuckled.

"Corpas! Eat!" called Soldier Korst.

They both got up to go to the fire, leaving their books behind.

"You're not going to do anything stupid are you?" asked Jack.

"I don't do stupid," replied Demic in a pointed tone, casting a
sidelong glance at Jack. "If you're going to be my manservant. My
expensive manservant. You need to learn how to address me
properly."

"I thought I had it about right," said Jack.

"Not even close."

Soldier Korst had already eaten the lion's share of the meat, but
there was still quite a lot there for the two of them to eat. The
soldier stalked off into the gathering gloom among the trees
without waiting for them to settle in.

"Where's he off to?" Jack asked in a whisper.

"If someone asked me to guess," Demic whispered back, then paused
for several moments for emphasis. "I'd say he's setting traps or
screamers around the camp. Maybe he doesn't like the idea of waking
up with a spear in his chest."

Jack felt a slow creep of embarrassment climbing towards his ears.
He was grateful when Dolce interupted the sensation by padding over
and plonking herself down beside him with a thump. He ran his
fingers through the thick hair at the back of her neck, noting that
she still looked exhausted. Nevertheless, she seemed to be taking
to the process of licking her chops clean with great relish. She
had energy enough for that.

***

Jack was walking through the forest. It was night, but the forest
floor was well lit. He looked up at the sky and saw that it was a
solid unrelieved black. No clouds. No moon. No stars.

Despite the light, he could only see a dozen or so paces ahead of
himself. Beyond that, the trees disappeared quickly into a
deceptively dense fog.

A terrified scream pierced the misty night air.

Jack walked on unperturbed, he had heard other screams like it
before. Soldier Korst was out there somewhere. Killing.

He was following a different sound. It was breathy and desperate,
and he had been walking $towards it for some time now. A trick of
the fog conveyed the sound to him as though it was right by his
ear, though he knew it was still in front of him in the fog. He
knew it was Dolce, though there was no reason why he should know
that just from the sound itself.

An outline peeked through the unusual fog and it whispered to him
of unease. The outline was not a clean line like Jack had come to
expect from the forest. The forest had a regularity about it, but
this was regular in a different way. It broke the balance of
symmetry that Jack had been traversing, and the breakage was just
as jaring as if something physical had been smashed before him.

He knew what it was too. He knew. He did not need it to resolve
more clearly, yet it did anyway as he stepped relentlessly forward
$towards the sound of panting.

There were seven of them. Each a shock against the cleanliness of
the fallen log they sat upon. Jack was close enough to see them
now, and they were close enough to see him. They stared intently
back at him. Not angrily. Not sadly. Just intently. A part of
Jack's mind said that the original heads had not had all their eyes
open, but that did not stop any of them from staring.

Jack's path was through them, an undeviated course would see him
leap upon the log among them and then walk on.

Jack did not want that. He fought against the path, though it was
like a rope pulling him through the fog. It pulled and Jack pushed.
Slowly, he crabbed to the side. The heads swivelled to watch him as
he drew closer. He was going to have to leap upon the log afterall.
He fought harder. He slipped painfully to the side. For a terrible
moment it was like he had hit a hard limit through which the rope
pulling him would not allow him to pass. He was going to collide
with the last head. He pushed.

And passed within an armspan of the last head, each pock mark, each
oily hair distinct to Jack's view as it swivelled with the other
heads to watch him pass.

For a moment, he lost the sound of Dolce's panting against the sound
of his own. It disorientated him and he came to a stop.

He did not want to stop there. Not with his back to the staring
heads. He calmed himself, an odd feeling, as even that effort had an
edge of desperation to it. He felt the pull again though and he
followed it eagerly.

He did not look back, but after a dozen or so steps he relaxed,
certain that the heads had been swallowed by the fog.

The panting did not grow louder, but Jack felt it draw closer. A
figure appeared out of the fog, roughly Jack's size. For a moment,
Jack thought it might be himself, as though he were looking at his
own back, but it was dressed too finely. The figure was looking
down at Dolce lying flat out on the ground, her chest heaving. He
looked around as Jack approached.

"Looks like you're not so strong afterall. She's dying," said
Demic, his tone a mixture of satisfaction and sadness.

Jack ignored him and rushed to Dolce's side. Her panting was like
the blowing of the bellows in the smithy shop that Stine worked. A
huge rushing of air rather than a wheeze.

Jack put his hands on Dolce's heaving chest, somehow certain that
there was something that he could do. Without pausing to think
about it he gave something to her. A gift. He gave it freely and
without condition.

Jack felt a warm glow in his hands and he imagined her strong
again, her body energised and well.

As though a huge load had been removed, her breathing suddenly
returned to normal, and Jack himself sighed with relief.

"Show off," said Demic in disgust.

A scream pierced the night, this time much closer and louder than
before. It did not seem like a human sound. It grew louder and
louder until it felt like it was beating at Jack's skull.

***

Jack jerked awake, his heart hammering. The scream was coming from
somewhere out in the forest. Demic was up on one elbow a short
distance away, his body encased in his bedding. Incredibly, Dolce,
who was lying beside Jack, was still sleeping. Her ear flicked
forward and then back, but other than that the loud scream did
nothing to rouse her.

The scream cut off suddenly. Silence descended except for the quiet
crackle of the fire.

The crunch of foodsteps sounded nearby and Jack swung around as
Soldier Korst entered the circle of fire light, his dog on his
heels.

"Just a roon, go back to sleep," he said, settling himself back
into his bedding by the fire. Soldier Korst's dog came by Jack and
sniffed at Dolce.

"Stay away from my dog," he growled at Jack. "Heel mut!"

His dog retreated back to him, head hanging sheepishly, and tail
wagging energetically.

Demic, satisfied that all was well, rolled over and seemed to go
directly back to sleep.

Jack did not bother to fight his own drowsiness. Imagining what a
troop of roons bounding through the forest might look like, he laid
down beside Dolce and fell straight asleep himself.

***

Soldier Korst rustled them into their saddles just after sunrise
and set a quick pace. As usual, the mules had no trouble keeping up
with the horses.

Dolce was rejuvenated. Either the food, the night's rest, or a
combination of both had done her wonders. She loped along beside
Risle so smoothly that Jack did not even think to worry about her
for half the morning. By the time he did take special notice, she
had proven that she was back in shape beyond any lingering fear
he may have harboured.

The road had begun to climb into hilly country, and the horses
slowed as they laboured up the inclines. For the most part
they were skirting the hills, yet ever onward and upward.

They stopped mid-morning to water the horses at a gulley that cut
close to the road. A small path led down through the trees to a
small stream. Jack took advantage of the pause to thank Soldier
Korst.

"For what?" asked the soldier.

"For saving Dolce. She was starving."

"She was hungry, not starving. She could have gone another week
without eating and gotten stronger every day. It wasn't the food
that fixed her. I don't know why she's better, but they'll work it
out up at Pamsley." Jack noticed a hint of menace in his tone, and
Jack wondered for the first time if Pamsley was going to be an
improvement for him afterall. Jack looked to Demic, hoping to gauge
his reaction, but the other boy was absorbed by his own thoughts
and not paying any attention.

Jack nudged Demic and was rewarded with a frown of displeasure,
which Jack ignored.

"What will your father do when he finds out what they did?"
whispered Jack.

"I don't know. But knowing him, I expect he'll have them challenged
to duels."

"Your father will come all this way to fight them himself?" Jack
asked in a hushed disbelieving tone.

"No," said Demic, clearly irritated. "Try to listen. He will
<i>have</i> them challenged. My father will ask one of his
soldier's, or even an imaginer to do it for him. He'll choose the
best. The duels are almost always fatal."

"Ah," exhaled Jack, comprehension dawning.

"Ah," Demic mimicked with condescending slowness.

Jack continued on as though he had not noticed.

"Do you have any men of your own?"

"Of course not. I have no rank. I'm not even a malkemist yet."

"You have me."

"No. I still need to ask my father. Though I don't know what
possessed me.  If I'm lucky, he'll say no."

"You do have something. You have information. Information that at
least two malkemists will do anything to keep from your father."

Jack left him with that and returned to the road.

A short time after that they rode into a great green valley. The
road was surrounded by many different crops stretching far into the
distance, and only ending when they butted against the wooded hills
that surrounded them.

"Welcome to Pamsley," said Demic.

"You've been here before?" asked Jack.

"No, but I've read my father's journal. He came here for final
testing, just like me." Demic pointed at a raised plateau in the
distance. "That's Upper Pamsley. It's reserved for full malkemists.
Candidate corpas hardly ever go up there."

"You two will go up there. There are important people on the hill
who rarely come down, but who will want to check you over for
themselves," interjected the soldier without looking around. "Keep
your heads down and your mouths shut, especially around the
grandmaster. You don't get to the top of that pile of vipers
without being twice as clever as everyone thinks you are. He looks
tough and dumb, but he's only tough."

"We're not stupid," muttered Demic.

They passed a few large stone buildings and several men in the
fields. Some wore the hat of a malkemist.

"Are those malkemists working as farm hands?" asked Jack, sidling
up close to Demic so that he would not be overheard. He was very
confused, and a little shocked.

Demic shrugged. "Everyone at Pamsley is from a malkemist family.
The title of malkemist goes to anyone who passes the tests. Some
malkemists can barely create an acid wash on their best day.  They
wear the hat, but they may as well be koyim for all they can
achieve with a plith crystal."

They broke into a trot and stopped talking. Dolce ran alongside
Jack on the road, showing none of her weakness from the day before,
despite the morning climb.

Jack was feeling good in the saddle. The sun was bright and the
wind was in his face. It smelt clean up here as well. Everything
looked healthy.

The few people on the road seemed much more interested in Dolce
than any of them, but Soldier Korst rode on seemingly oblivious.

They arrived at a large stone bridge over a modestly wide river.
It looked old, but extremely sturdy. On the far bank was a small
town girded on one side by the river and on the other by the cliff
face under the plateau. The bridge and the houses were made of the
same stone, but different from the stone Corsisan had been built
from. Even the rooves were a different colour. In Corsisan, the
rooves were an orange colour, while here the rooves were much
darker, almost brown.

If it had been Soldier Korst's intention to sneak into town without
alerting anyone, the loud clack of sixteen metal-shod shoes on the
bridge would have undone him. As it was, it would have been
impossible anyway, since four malkemists—each astride a beautiful
mount—sat waiting on the other side as Jack's party took the crest.

Jack's mind boggled at that for a moment. No one had seemed to take
the slightest interest in them throughout the long ride along the
valley. All of a sudden, they were worth a four malkemist reception
committee.

Jack now knew how how much effort went into saddling a horse. These
men had been forewarned of their arrival well in advance. The rats in
the shanty town could send crude warnings to each other across and
along streets, but none of those methods would have worked here.
Jack promised himself that he would find out how they had done it
later.

"Soldier Korst," greeted one of the malkemists. The tone was bored,
not hostile, and Jack relaxed a little. He, and the others, wore
black robes that Jack recognised as more traditional malkemist
garb.

He tensed up again almost immediately when he noticed that Demic
had bowed in his saddle, and he rushed to emulate him quickly, anxious
not to offend.

"Soldier Raigne."

"Delivering candidates I take it? Is this Corpa Demic?" Soldier
Raigne's gesture took in the crippled boy.

"Yep, that's him," Soldier Korst nodded.

"Varley, put your dog away and we'll take you up."

Soldier Korst winced. "She isn't mine."

"What?" asked Soldier Raigne, a sudden edge in his voice.

"It's a long story. She belongs to this corpa. Corpa Jack,"
explained Soldier Korst. He looked slightly embarrassed. "None of
this is my idea. One master wanted him bought here, and another
thought it would be a good idea to let him keep the simulcra."
Soldier Korst turned his free hand up. "Out of my hands."

"Assholes," commiserated one of the other soldiers. Jack was sure
by the way he casually delivered the curse that he did so often.

"He can't wander through Pamsley with a weapon like her," insisted
Soldier Raigne. "Even masters aren't allowed to flout the rules
like that. Who let him use a plith crystal anyway?"

"No one, that's the thing. That's why it's here and not destroyed.
He did something to take over the simulcra from its previous
owner."

"Maybe he shouldn't be wandering around Pamsley at all," piped in
another soldier. He had a narrow face and sharp eyes.

"Just so," agreed Soldier Korst with a nod.

"Is there anything else I should know about?" asked Soldier Raigne.

Soldier Korst pursed his lips with a considering frown. "Well, he
cut the heads off half a dozen koyim. All nice clean cuts too. So I
guess he's handy with an axe, though you wouldn't know it to look
at the runt."

Demic, his mule close by Jack's, whispered out of the side of his
mouth. "Sloppy idiot. I shouldn't know that."

Jack was too busy keeping his face perfectly expressionless and his
eyes focused in the distance, to pay immediate attention to the
comment.

"Sounds like a right little monster, you'll be looking forward to a
good night's sleep I expect," said the final malkemist.

"I am, but not on account of him."

"Devid, send a query to Upper. Tell them the situation and ask for
directions," requested Soldier Raigne.

The last malkemist to speak wheeled his horse around abruptly and
took up a tube that had been tied behind his saddle. He sighted it
towards the plateau above and started tapping and fiddling with it.
Jack could not tell what he was about. He finished and then sat
still, as though waiting for something. The other malkemists seemed
to think this was completely normal.

"Any news from Hunter's Vale or the road?" asked the foul-mouthed
malkemist.

"I heard rumours of news, but no real news. Something about another
war in the west. A couple of attacks on malkemists in coastal
towns. That sort of thing."

"We've heard the same up here, and some other stuff. Was there a
skirmish between Hunter and Roon Library? Some guy, an archivist,
came to petition the grandmaster with a complaint against Hunter
Library. Maybe you'll be able to clear things up."

"Probably not. I haven't had much to do with Roon Library. Outside
my concern."

"Pity. It would've been good to have another perspective. Maybe the
corpa knows something you don't?"

Soldier Korst laughed. "Since when does anyone tell a corpa shit?
Did something change up here while I was away?"

Foul-mouth scowled at that, but did not press on.

"Have you ever rotated in to defend Pamsley?" asked the
narrow-faced soldier.

"Never had the pleasure," responded Soldier Korst. "I must not have
made the cut."

"Never fear. They eventually call up every soldier who was
candidated here. I presume you were a candidate?"

"Oh, yes. I remember it fondly."

Both narrow-face and foul-mouth snorted with coarse amusement at
that.

"They say to bring them up," said Soldier Devid suddenly. "Bind and drag
the dog though."

Jack looked sharply at Soldier Devid, alarmed.  Dolce reacted by
baring her teeth and growling deep in her throat.

"Well blow me over, they really are connected," said Soldier
Raigne. "Take her quick Erold."

Narrow-face cut across the other riders towards Dolce, his left
hand pulling a vill from within his robes. Without considering what
he was doing, Jack drove Risle forward and she collided with the
malkemist's horse, pushing it away from Dolce.

"Careful, gentlesirs. You don't want to let him touch any of
your vills," Soldier Korst called out helpfully, though in a tone
that left no doubt in anyone's mind that this was none of his
business.

"Jack! Stop!" yelled Demic.

Soldier Erold stared into Jack's face for a moment, confusion on
his features. They were close enough to touch. The malkemist's
horse danced away from Risle, and Jack had a moment for the
enormity of what he had just done to sink in. He had the ridiculous
impulse to apologise, but of course it was too late for that.
During the brief pause, Dolce had flanked the malkemist's horse and
lunged. The horse shied away quickly enough to avoid her jaws, but
almost lost its rider in the process.

Soldier Erold was angry now, and the other riders were stepping
their horses back to give them room as his horse righted itself.
The harried soldier released a stream of liquid at the she-dog. She
tried to sidestep the flow, but it struck her hindquarters. Jack
expected it to splash off, but instead it stuck fast to her fur.
She tried to pull away, but a long thick cord of the stuff now
connected the soldier's pommel to the she-dog. He tried to pull her
from her feet, but she was far too heavy for that. He quickly
changed his approach and whipped the cord along her flank instead.
Everywhere it touched her, it stuck fast.

Dolce tried to bite down on the cord, but that proved to be a
terrible mistake. The moment she bit into it, her jaws were gummed
tightly shut by the gooey substance.

Trapped. Jack could feel her panic. She pulled and tugged, yanking
the horse into misstep after misstep, but each time she changed
direction, the soldier would strike another part of her with the
cord and bind her up more tightly.

Eventually, after several turns of this, two of her feet were bound
up off the ground and she could barely stand. Every time she tried
to escape, she would stumble to the roadway. Every time it was
harder for her to get up.

Jack jumped from Risle's back and rushed to her side. He hugged
her huge neck to stop her from struggling further. She was only
making things worse. He noticed that he could touch the cord
without it sticking to him.

He could feel her calming down, but she was still anxious. Jack
realised that she was probably feeding off his own excitement. He
tried to reassure her by calming himself.

Just when he thought it might be working, Soldier Erold leaned in
and swung his fist at Jack's head. Jack ducked under the blow, but
his reaction set Dolce to growling and struggling viciously again.

"That's enough Erold," warned Soldier Raigne. "The job's done.

"You!" he belted out with some force, his finger aimed firmly
between Jack's eyes. "Get back on your horse."

"Mule," Jack muttered under his breath.

"What?" the soldier challenged, but Jack kept his mouth shut, his
heart hammering.

He petted Dolce one more time before returning to Risle and
climbing back into the saddle.

"That was stupid," whispered Demic. Then, a few moments later. "But
also quite brave."

Soldier Korst rolled his eyes.

The sticky cord had completely immobilised Dolce now and she was
lying on her side panting on the road. The ruckus had drawn a small
crowd of onlookers, mostly boys and girls older than Jack.

"Dukard!" called Soldier Raigne, looking at a large boy among the
onlookers. "Hitch a horse and cart for this dog, its too heavy to
throw over a saddle."

The boy in question did not run to obey, instead he turned to
another boy at his side and seemed to give a terse order. He stood
still while three of his companions sprinted off.

In almost no time at all they were back leading a horse hitched to
a simple cart. They drew the cart alongside Dolce. All three of
them gathered around her and tried to lift her from the ground,
which drew some laughter from the malkemists. They may as well have
been trying to lift a horse.

Dukard himself came forward with two girls, and after a short
discussion, they arranged themselves around the she-dog more
carefully.

With the six of them, they were able to lift Dolce off the ground,
but not all the way to the cart.

"Varley, that's enough. Erold, Stint, Devid. Give them a hand."

The three of them were ready, as though they had suspected that it
would fall to them afterall. Erold took the cord and stuck it to
itself in a loop attached to Dolce's shoulders and haunches. He
climbed up on the cart with Stint, and they both twined a section
of the cord around their forearms for purchase. Stint over Dolce's
rump and Erold over her shoulders.

Meanwhile, Devid set two of the boys up as human rails for Dolce to
slide up onto the cart. When all was ready the two soldiers on the
cart pulled mightily while the remaining two boys and two girls and
Devid pushed and lifted from below. For a moment, it looked like
they would fail again, but once they had her moving upward she shot
up in a rush. Once on the cart, the two soldier simply rolled her
legs up and over to move her a little farther down the cart, and
then left her there.

"That's one big dog," grumbled Devid. "Are you sure he's sustaining
it? It hardly seems possible."

"Pretty sure," responded Soldier Korst laconically.

"Thank you Corpa Dukard. Come along, you'll need to bring the cart
back down," said Soldier Raigne.

With Dolce tied in, the small troop of malkemists wheeled around
and led the way upward through the town. One of the corpas held the
reins of the horse leading the cart, while Corpa Dukard and the
others followed along behind. The rest of the crowd melted away in
the sun.

The town was held in check by the river on one side, and the steep
side of the hill on the other. The town was quite long and took
time to traverse, despite the quality of the cobblestoned main
road. The river flowed close to the hill in front of them, but
before the path was cut off, the road narrowed and began to climb
the hill. It was not particularly steep in any one place, but the
climb was long and unrelenting.

They reached the plateau and Jack was impressed by the large space.
There were three very large stone buildings nearby, but neat
gardens and lawns dominated the majority of the plateau. The space
between the buildings was cobbled in the same stone as the road. He
wondered briefly at the labour it had taken to construct.

The courtyard was filled with raised beds of flowers. White marble
steps, flanked by smooth thick columns, led up to the main entrance
of the largest building, with two fierce bear statues rearing at
the foot of the stairs. The boy leading the cart stopped it in
front of the marble stairs.

"What? You think the dog is going to use the grand entrance? I
don't even use the grand entrance idiot," called out the
foul-mouthed Soldier Stint as he rode by. "Get your ass to the
stables."

The boy looked embarrassed, but it was Corpa Dukard that he looked
warily at, not the malkemist, before he led the horse forward
again.

At the stables, the boys unhitched the cart from the horse's
harness, and holding on to the poles, lowered the back end to the
ground. The tray of the cart grew steeper and steeper until Dolce
rolled over and out onto the ground. Dolce was not hurt, but it
still made Jack red hot with anger. He heard Dolce's growl rumbling
in her chest.

"Control yourself," warned Demic. "She follows your emotions. If
they think she's dangerous, they'll hurt her."

Jack took a deep breath to calm himself and tried to pretend that
Dolce was fine. His jaw did not unclench.

Stablehands came out of the stable to take control of the animals.

"Take you saddlebags, corpas. The stablemaster will keep your
mounts and your saddles straight for you," said Soldier Korst, he
addressed the both of them, but only Jack needed to be told.

Jack swung his saddlebags over his shoulder and petted Risle before
going to Dolce and giving her a reassuring rub as well.

"Hurry up," said Soldier Raigne, heading towards the side entrance
to the main building. "Masters are not known for their patience."

Jack struggled a little under the weight of his saddlebags. He
stumbled after Soldier Raigne singlemindedly, but not so
singlemindedly that he did not duck when he felt a sudden shadow
cover him. Something struck him a glancing, stinging blow to the
side of his head. He dropped to the ground and tumbled free of his
saddlebags to come to his feet. His hand reached for his knife, but
of course it was not there.

"Next time I'll take your head off," growled Soldier Erold.

Jack bared his teeth and Dolce went crazy.

"You want more?!" threatened the soldier, lifting his fist. Jack
noticed for the first time that it was encased in a metal gauntlet.

Jack glared at the soldier for a moment, a feeling of sick dread
rising in him as he realised how badly he was outclassed, but the
contumaceous core of him refusing to back down. Instead of
responding, Jack freed himself from the showdown by turning back to
Dolce and running to her. She was fighting a ferocious and losing
battle against the cord that bound her, tearing great tufts of her
fur out by the roots. A part of his mind prickled to have the
soldier at his back, but he forced himself not to turn around
again. Dolce heaved violently back and forth, threatening injury to
herself every moment. Jack put his hands to her surging flesh,
trying to calm her.

"Stupid animal. Nothing can break that cord," spat Soldier Erold,
his voice a little closer than before.

Jack's fear for Dolce turned to white-hot rage. He grabbed the
cord, intending to pull it apart with his bare bands as tears of
impotence welled in his eyes.

Snap. The cord gave way so suddenly that the crack of it made his
hands smart. Tufts of hair settled on Dolce's body where she had
torn them loose during her struggles.

Soldier Erold screamed in pain and rage, and Jack spun around
quickly to see what game the man was playing at now.

The soldier was clutching at his head in pain. Meanwhile, Dolce
scrambled maladroitly against the cobblestones to gain her feet.
The soldier fixed a malevolent eye on Jack.

"What the fuck did you do?!" he roared, taking a lumbering step
towards Jack.

Dolce got to him first. She was scratching and slipping over the
cobblestones, but she still knocked the malkemist over when she
bowled into him.

"Corpa!" yelled Soldier Korst in warning, before continuing in a
carrying tone devoid of concern or anxiety. "Killing a malkemist
outside of a duel means death."

Jack threw himself at Dolce just as she sank her teeth into the
malkemist's side. The soldier tried to scream, but the effort came
out more like a squeek. Jack hugged her tight as he felt her tense,
ready to shake her mighty head.

"No!" Jack yelled. Then, "no, no, no," he crooned much more
quietly. "No, no, no."

Dolce did not release her grip on the man, yet neither did she try
to shake him to death.

"Let him go Corpa," called Soldier Raigne from afar, as though he
expected Jack to have that kind of control.

Jack did not look up from Dolce. He petted her carefully, trying to
avoid the patches of bare blood-prickled skin where she had torn
her fur out.

"Shh," he soothed, over and over. He leaned tentatively away from
her, watching for her reaction.

"Come, let's go," he urged, putting some distance between the two
of them and hoping that she would understand. He got up and walked
a few paces before repeating himself.

Somewhat more confident that she was no longer on the brink of
violence, he walked several steps farther towards large building
before turning back.

"Come."

He let out a sigh of relief when she finally released the soldier
and trotted over to him.

Soldier Erold groaned and rolled over onto his stomach. Jack kept a
tense eye on Soldier Raigne and Soldier Korst, wondering what they
would do. He had no time to look away from them, but no one else
was moving in the courtyard. All eyes were on Jack and Dolce, or
Soldier Raigne.

"Devid. See to him," called out Soldier Raigne in a tone of slight
disgust, indicating the downed malkemist. He turned on his heel
without waiting for acknowledgement and headed again for the side
entrance.

Jack rushed to pick up his saddlebags again and followed, Dolce in
tow. He was quite sure that no one wanted Dolce inside the
beautiful building, but both Soldier Korst and Soldier Raigne were
a dozen paces ahead by the time he reached the large doorway.
Neither forbade her from entering, so Jack made no effort to stop
her either. Not that he would have willingly left her outside
anyway.

The malkemists strode quickly ahead, and both corpas had to
alternatively skip and walk just to keep up. Jack gauged the
lengths of the corridors they walked, and the turns, on the odd
chance that he might need to get out by himself.

Dolce's paws clacked loudly on the marble floors and the sound
reverberated from the ceiling high above. If the soldiers had
simply forgotten about Dolce, she now forced them to actively
ignore her. Jack's own feet made more noise than he liked, thanks
to his boots. He rolled the sole from the outside heel through to
the outside front, and then laid the rest of the foot down
carefully with each step, but he still unable to walk silently in
them.

Soldier Raigne abruptly disappeared through a doorway, followed by
Soldier Korst. Rows of benches lined the walls either side of the
doorway, yet Demic did not stop or even pause at the threshold, so
neither did Jack.

Inside, Soldier Korst was taking a seat in one of several armchairs
resting against a wall, and Soldier Raigne had already passed
through one of the three doors that led from the room. The whole
room was filled with art, but Jack's eyes were drawn to the ceiling
high above his head. Fantastic scenes covered the surface. He could
make no sense of them, yet he gawked nonetheless. It was only when
he lowered his gaze that he saw the many, many portraits that
nestled among the calved and painted landscape that covered the
walls. Stern-faced men and women stared down disapprovingly on Jack
and Dolce.

Under those many eyes, Jack felt strangely bashful and timid about
finding a seat for himself. The room was large enough that he could
sit apart from either Soldier Korst or Demic, so he did.

Dolce did not flop to the floor when Jack stopped moving, as was
her habit.  Instead, she remained standing, scanning the room and
watching each doorway in turn.

Jack tried to calm himself down again to reassure her, but his own
heart was still hammering from what had happened in the courtyard.

He felt a tickle on his cheek, like a cool bead of sweat, except
that it was far too cold for sweat. He brushed the sensation away
with his fingers and it felt slick rather than merely wet. His
fingers were bloody when he pulled them away. Soldier Erold had
gotten him better than Jack had thought. He reached up gingerly to
find the wound and was rewarded with a sharp sting right where he
expected to find it. His hair was gummed up below the wound. The
blood had dripped down around his ear and down his neck to his
shirt.

He sat with his hand in front of him for a moment, wondering how to
clean it off. Usually, he would have just wiped it against his
pants, but his new pants were far too nice for that. Dolce sniffed
at him, then his hand, and then started licking the blood from his
fingers. It tickled, but in a good way. She cleaned them up in
short order.

Jack was considering letting her lick his neck clean when Soldier
Raigne came out of the door on the left wall with an elderly
malkemist. The older man looked down his nose disapprovingly at
Dolce and then transferred the same gaze to Jack.

"Mind you don't bleed on my chair boy."

Jack nodded and the old man returned the way he had come without
speaking to anyone else. Soldier Raigne gave a nod to Soldier Korst
and left.

The three of them were left in the cool silence of the huge waiting
room. Jack listened to the sound of Soldier Raigne's footsteps as
they faded down the corridor they had all entered through.

The minutes ticked by. Literally. A large grandfather clock set the
quiet, hushed tone of the room with its incessant tick, tock. Jack
amused himself by blinking on every tick.

Neither Soldier Korst nor Demic seemed to find the wait unusual, so
Jack resolved to handle it with just as much dignity. Demic had
taken out a book to read, and Jack followed suit with his own
poorly disguised copy of <i>The Ethics of Creating Simulcra</i>.

Occassionally, a voice or a scuff would be heard outside the room,
but the silence was never long broken. Soldier Korst seemed to be
sleeping.

Even Dolce relaxed enough to slump to the ground.

Jack was reading slowly. He was quite sure it was saying that
simulcra were a threat to other living creatures. Jack was still
learning why.

A scuff sounded from the hallway and Jack expected it to fade like
the others before it, but instead the scuff turned into several and
drew closer. A sharp angry voice cracked down the corridor and then
fell silent again.

Jack stared tensely at the door and Dolce sprung back to her feet.
Demic looked up curiously from his book, while Soldier Korst either
slept or pretended to.


I awoke to hissing, like two hoses kissing.
My cryogenic bed, where I had lain to rest,
had suddenly been drained, till the air touched my head.
The air within smelt stale, with either gas or must,
I coughed up red liquid, struggling to be hale.

Was this the place I chose, to take my long repose?
Now my small safety room, seemed dark and foreboding,
before so inviting, now a crypt filled with gloom.
I stumbled from the hood, old memories ill used,
the exit was this way, but the stone portal stood.

I commanded it open, it seemed to be broken.
A century strong door, it could not have failed,
the design was flawless, I had read the brochure.
I recalled the failsafe, and reached for the panel,
now just dust on the floor, my panic started to chafe.

The crowbar I recalled, and with glee I did bawl.
The locker was once here, and plastic cannot rust;
yet time had played the same, and left none of the gear.
The stone door forbade me, as it sat in judgment;
it judged me unworthy, to be granted the key.

Something jolted again in my hibernate brain.
The door had a fine pivot, and I might push it open,
under condition of fail, maker no idiot
